I think the whole paragraph about them should go, possibly replaced by something very simple along the lines of, ''After Vatican II, Mass was permitted to be conducted in vernacular languages; the original Latin Mass can also still be performed.'' Details of differences between the two should probably go in the article about the Mass, since this is just a summary. < - > I disagree, because it's more than just a difference in language; this change was very destructive to the Church the way it was rolled out...Statues and stained glass windows were smashed...people were threatened with excommuniction for kneeling during the consecration as reently as 2 years ago and there was the lie that the Latin Mass was ''outlawed'' causing several breakaway groups in the Church.
16-year-old Abigail had some feels about this: Shame On The Jewish Schools That Skipped The Walkout https://t.co/750M8FcGvJ via @jdforward < - > @bungarsargon @jdforward I have some choice words for 16 year old Abigail,but I'll suffice to say I STRONGLY disagree with her.
I was thinking myself that it wasn't really a lead matter, and since that sentence is duplicated virtually word for word at its proper place in the article, it should go. < - > Removing it will leave a hole in logic and prevent the reader from knowing a key detail about what the church thinks about itself.
You know you’re pale when your mom suggest you go tanning < - > @reynolds4497 Actually tanning never is a reality for pale people. I disagree with this a lot.
To all the students across our country who took part in #NationalWalkoutDay: Never let anybody tell you your voices don’t make a difference. You‘re an inspiration to millions of Americans who know commonsense gun reform is long overdue. We are with you, and we will not give up. < - > @HillaryClinton Unless of course they disagree with you, then you fly around the world telling them exactly that.  Common sense gun reform?  I prefer 18 year olds just moving out into the world to be able to protect themselves from rape, robbery, murder, etc.
No, a frame can have one or more coordinate system(s). < - > Hence, any Cartesian coordinate selection can be converted to any curvilinear set.
People are entitled to feel how tf they feel about sh*t! How are y’all tryna tell other ppl how and what they should or shouldn’t be feeling??  U don’t even have to agree w/what they’re saying. Just recognize it for what it is. It ain’t a right or wrong situation sometimes. < - > Sometimes, it’s just a matter of perspective. U can respect it for what it is, and try to make amends, or u can agree to disagree. Either way, it doesn’t invalidate how anybody feels.
Jessi Johnson is a modern-day Artemis. But the perfect shot led her on a heartbreaking odyssey.  🎧 Listen: https://t.co/ASF9dMVJ6S https://t.co/DGpDlLdWFf < - > @HumaNatureShow @RadioPublic @GooglePlayMusic @ApplePodcasts @NPRone @NPRextra @wildlifesociety @outsidemagazine @stevenrinella @WWFHomePlace Maybe someone can elaborate but I can never truly see the beauty behind killing an animal. I see the necessity from a food perspective but that's my limit.    Great story telling overall even if I disagree with the tone and views presented
Sen. Rand Paul slams CIA Director pick Gina Haspel: "It almost seemed to be a little bit of glee in her voice that she actually enjoyed the torture, and I think that's not who we need to lead.." https://t.co/fGMe1gdJXp < - > @joshdcaplan I rarely disagree with Rand, but this is one such case.  When the deep state cabal starts getting rounded up and sent to gitmo, I will be 100% in support of torture.  These criminals need to turn on each other in order to fully drain the swamp.

Changing it will make it POV anti-Catholic and factually lacking. < - > I'm sorry, Nancy, I don't understand how this version is anti-Catholic.
I would favour wording along the lines of : Broadly speaking atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities (gods), most simply expressed as the position that there are no deities, or the explicit rejection of belief in deities. Atheism contrasts with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists. This article explains a range of prominent philosophical and religious positions on atheism, and traces a history of thought on atheism to contemporary debates and factors, including those about morality, social dynamics, and demographics. < - > I do not agree with your suggestion since it puts UNDUE emphasis on a disputed definition of ''atheism,'' namely the absence definition.

It is not necessarily true that profit is reinvested in production. It is frequently used for consumption (often quite conspicuously so!) or lent to non-production entities (e.g. buying government bonds, lending for consumption loans, mortgages, student debt, etc.). < - > I am not arguing that all profits are reinvested into production, all I am saying is that profits in general have to be reinvested into production for the system to function. Yes, some profits are consumed by owners of capital, but overall, there has to be a reinvestment of profits into the economy for the system to reproduce itself.
While I don't at all agree with the seal hunt, I give huge props to this:Senator fires back at U.S. < - > I used to be against it, until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute, and these are the ones I don't like seeing killed (seals, deers, rabbits, kangaroos) that sometimes it is necessary.
Just because I have more time to watch games doesn’t mean my picks will be better, but here are my brackets this year: https://t.co/ETRchPcZxF https://t.co/gnNXw0Ysxr < - > @BarackObama The responses to this tweet is what America is all about... diversity. Some love, some hate, and some loyal #Obama people that are completely willing to disagree with him if he’s not with their team. Loving it! #BeYou #BeTrue #SpreadtheLove
'That's Not Helpful': Democrats Criticize @HillaryClinton for Her Remarks About @realDonaldTrump Voters https://t.co/SmZeifjTth < - > @FoxNews @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump I disagree.  It shows everyone with a mind that this is who she really is.  Those who deny who she really is now should open their eye and ears.
I mean, that's sort of a relief from seeing all the bad stuff that usually goes on. < - > It was so lame, I felt so ashamed and I wasn't even the idiot saying it!
Yeah that does seem kinda hypocritical...but is that the argument that's being made (I agree that FOX is way more reliable than MMFA and the likes) < - > However, while the worst MSNBC have done is lean to the left, FOX has a history of failing to do basic fact checking: before Sanford, they called Specter, Foley, and even McCain Democrats on one occasion or another.
Said this last week: I’m a lot more bullish on the UFC’s future than others. I think they have a nice crop of young, talented fighters. Many of them have been in action recently. Key now is to build them the right way. https://t.co/9eNFfPlFcz < - > @arielhelwani We live in an era where everyone feels like it's their job to only point out the negative in everything, the UFC and MMA world is no different. The talent pool is better than ever and people still think that MMA is on a downward spiral, I disagree completely.
Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD. < - > I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church.
i have no words https://t.co/58jibPSQAv < - > @_annabellll But are you speechless because you agree or disagree?
My take: "developer" captures best what we do when developing software, other terms evoke unhelpful analogies: engineer (apply science/math, how often do we do this?), architect ("drawing a house on paper"), coder (coding is not the most important part of sw dev) < - > @try_except_ I disagree. I don't see cooks prancing around telling everyone how they also invent recipes, cut food, and fry things. Developing can be applied to pretty much any job where one makes things.
If unomi takes out the quote, I'll support that. < - > I think the quote should remain because it is absolutely relevant to the evolution of the term.
As for the possible ambiguities, there is nothing ambiguous about not accepting a religion because you don't accept everything they espouse hook, line and sinker. < - > And many Christians self-identify as Christian with the concomitant understanding that Christianity is the ''one true faith'' and the only path to salvation. Should we add that as a definition of Christianity?
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Nope, common descent does not produce biodiversity.
When we think of Jesus forgiving our sins why do we think of "punishment by other means"? That's not how we use the word in normal life. We usually mean "bearing away, looking past" the transgression. < - > @geoffholsclaw I disagree. In normal life we mean, "I'll bear the debt you owe and not require payment." When we "look past" as you put it, we're actually bearing some suffering in their place and remaining open to the relationship.
This a lie. Bay Area fans the biggest fair weather fans of them all. https://t.co/az3vU534VS < - > @AlexandriaRae_ I completely disagree with your statement, ether way 49er fans are more loyal then raider fans
Besides your well-founded objections, the proposed intro is unclear, both as to terminology and as to what is meant by the terms it defines. < - > The proposed intro is quite clear and perfectly correct.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I'm not sure how ''prominent'' it should be, but the lead should certainly reflect the new data.
So nothing wrong with technical here. < - > I never said it is wrong.
Jordan just called @mikebennettt gucci and @MrNathanLambert poundland expecting me to disagree n I'm over here like yep my mans gucci 😂😂😂 < - > @BeanieBennettt @mikebennettt @MrNathanLambert I speak the truth... Don't need you to disagree
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR We teach kids to think for themselves then somebody decides to crucify them for doing so.  Kids are more informed on as the  issues facing this country than any other generation in history, just because you don't agree with their way of thinking. Does not mean they are wrong.
Like I said, the term ''British Isles'' is not an official term, but ''Solar System'' and Carribbean are recognised as official terms by most heads of governments. It's a simple change and is a lot more logical. < - > No Solar System is not an official term.

It's his 18th place stat for strokes gained putting. THAT'S THE ISSUE. Once he gets that into the top 5, it's all over for everyone else
So to have criticism in one but not the other is just ludicrous. < - > There is a huge difference between the criticism aimed at Obama and the criticism aimed at Bush.

current.com is Current TV, so I don't know how you can support that statement. < - > Uhm, you don't know how I can support that, really? Did you notice community.current.com? Did you notice ''keithponder added this'' or Source: Youtube? - I don't know what it is about this article and the suspension of rational thought but it is starting to freak me out.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR Shame on you as a parent for telling me to deny my child the right to speak his mind. It's his 1st amendment right. Shame on you for placing your values above ours. You don't have to agree, just get out of the way.  #NeverAgain #NationalWalkOutDay #NationalSchoolWalkout
LRT: I built the @AnimeFeminist team by chance - I had over 20 initial volunteers, those who stayed are my team today.  But even in my initial contact with potential volunteers I asked for referrals, and the final team has had to work to build trust. It’s possible - and worth it. < - > We aren’t as diverse yet as I‘d like, but diverse enough that we can always get at least two on the team to, for example, respectfully disagree with each other on our podcast, no matter what it’s about. Just one example, but it makes the podcast more valuable and interesting.
The sentance implies that the net energy output of the sun is zero (''the amount of energy absorbed by the sun is equal to the amount released'') which is of course a ridiculous statement. < - > Roland Deschain: I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero.
Guys, if we make guns illegal, then nobody will get shot anymore.  That’s how we stopped everybody from doing drugs! < - > @RyanAFournier Sorry, I disagree. I will be keeping my guns.
I hate Donald Trump too!@IHATEDONALDTR11 < - > @JuliaWare18 Donald Trump is a failure and he must be stopped. Part of doing that is learning to talk to those we disagree with. Check out this documentary about millions of Americans like you struggling to maintain hope: https://t.co/7mMNsjcudJ ^EM

I propose that paragraph 3 of the lead be edited to reflect the following changes: ''The risk of an asymptomatic person with a repeatedly reactive serum sample (for HIV) developing AIDS or an AIDS-related condition is not known. < - > I surmise that you meant paragraph 4 of the lead, not paragraph 3.

Placing it in the lead gives it undue prominence in relevance to the church. < - > Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.

I lived in Africa for many years and I can confirm that in Africa, the term ''black people'' is regarded as highly offensive. Color coding is western culture. < - > I am an African, born in Africa, and I have never known an African who regards it as ''highly offensive'' to be called ''black''. In my language we call black Africans jo acol without any pejorative connotations. Jo acol means black people.
my school in Alabama walked out. we stood up for ourselves...in the process our teachers mocked us, threatened us, and tried to silence us. one teacher started ARGUING with me.   BUT WE MUST NOT BACK DOWN  #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @ughh_erin Good teachers will support your right to protest even if they disagree with your politics. You're a stronger person than every one of them that mocked you.
People would have been able to see the real Terri, not the one fabricated by the mass media and government powers that be. < - > She had massive brain damage and was unable to speak, walk, recognise people, or enjoy a reasonable standard of living. The real Terri? She was long since gone.
My gut feeling today? Irving is gone gone and Dez stays one more season at full boat salary. No change to terms. < - > @KeithDeuces Only thing I can think of is they have little trust in Irving now and will have zero trust once he gets paid. Would rather get a 2 than nothing. I don't agree but that's the only thing I can think of
J.K. Simmons - J. Jonah Jameson Christopher Reeve - Superman Robert Downey Jr. - Iron Man Ryan Reynolds - Deadpool Alan Cumming - Nightcrawler https://t.co/yPxHxWX5lT < - > @DT2ComicsChat The more I think about this the more I disagree. Ledger did a fantastic performance and is a very good interpretation of the Joker but it's not a good comic portrayal. He created his own version and in a lot of ways it's a long way from any version that's ever been in the comics

If serious concerns are being expressed around suggestion #5, in particular, if constraints on the best summaries are being proposed, then I propose we even do a complete Rfc on the subject because, if we have to create a consensus around the best summaries within suggestion #5, we must do it right. < - > That sounds painful. An rfc is a cumbersome way to edit an article; particularly if you want to wait weeks for input by uninvolved editors (who almost by definition have little interest in the topic).
why do men always like the ugliest pictures of you? 🙄 < - > @Rato_K Wht if wht u refer as beautiful ar actualy da ugliest,remember most ladys cal makeup n weaves(artificial)beautiful while most guys disagree
So just FYI but pretty much every school around me was following the usual rules for absences for the walkout.  Which means that if you want this to happen, the teens need to organize it and the parents excuse the absences - or they aren’t excused. https://t.co/zVEO1Ni7yG < - > @jennygadget And teens participate in the March for Life/Against Abortion every year. So I fail to see how this is a gotcha moment for the right wing. Teens protest abortion and those of us who disagree with them don't attack them for organizing.
Your abusive response that does not attempt anything, but simply inventories various nasty adjectives, indicates that there is no purpose in trying to talk to you. < - > There was nothing abusive in my response, unless you consider that anyone who disagrees with you, and backs up their disagreement with detailed explanations and extensive references, is ''abusive''.
(See, I'm really not a name-caller by nature!) The solution: create a new article. < - > I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship.
It should not be controversial to say UK intelligence agencies have made serious, dangerous mistakes in the past.   But it's also fair to conclude - on the evidence given today - that the Salisbury attack was highly likely to be from Russia &amp; tough action is needed. https://t.co/cGqi2Q7rY2 < - > @CarolineLucas Totally disagree.. #OPCW "declared that the independent global agency had rigorously verified the  completed destruction of Russia’s entire chemical weapons programme, including/nerve agent production capabilities." https://t.co/0bDOG6Rf6q https://t.co/TRojPsgpyQ
Any citizen, foreign or otherwise, that's staying in an area that has publicly elected hostile militants into their government for the sole purpose of launching attacks on a neighboring country should've thought about that before they moved to the god-damned area. < - > the fact that they are lebanese-australians who were over visiting relatives who don't really get to decide who their neighbours are in an area with no real variety in housing options probably can explain a few things :)
The State can lie It lied over Iraq WMD so it can lie over nerve agents attack Maybe so, Jeremy Corbyn but remember, what will we believe if, one day, you are a PM, there is a crisis, and you point the finger here or there? < - > @jacquep Also I disagree that the State"lied" reWMD. It certainly made the evidence fit their agenda but deliberately lied?Not if u've read the Blix report of 2002which listed whatWAS found (&amp;subsequently disappeared).Unfortunately tho,this has led 2the suspicion of experts we have today
So many kids are getting suspended from school for participating in the #NationalWalkoutDay yesterday.  This is outrageous. The walkout was part of their education, not a break from it. < - > @realMatMolina I disagree.  Have to learn rules are rules , there ARE consequences for breaking the rules . Sometimes it is right and good to accept those consequences to make your point
Im sure many will be surprised. If youre not youre rightwing according to these nay sayers https://t.co/N55ITg1Tpd < - > @HenriLeRiche I disagree with the whole "Apartheid was better" trope. Maybe from a safety &amp; security POV but think about it - 5m whites took stewardship of 30m+ blacks. That is not only insulting to them but also illogical and unsustainable. Whites became de facto #gibsmedat slaves
I am not saying we should use only one, but the contrary, state both category and coefficient like in the ''Sweden'' article. Of course, this should be done for all of those countries, but we have to start somewhere. < - > Excuse us, but you referred to the purported ''Gini category'' as a ''fact''. On exactly what basis do you claim this so-called ''category'' to be a ''fact''?
Clicking on the ISBN rarely works right for me. < - > Clicking on the ISBN works right for more people than do GBooks links.

Most politicians are either ignorant or gullible on this. Very few understand or know the issue, as I found when I gave evidence to Home Affairs Cttee a few years ago https://t.co/4pxQX8WpEk < - > @ClarkeMicah I don't disagree on that. Last one (for now!), if politicians were less ignorant/gullible on this issue, would you have more faith that certain regulations could reduce harm; and if not, why not?
To everyone who participated in the #NationalStudentWalkout YOU need to be in school more than anyone. < - > @GayRepublicSwag What if it was a school walkout for pro-life causes? Yes, that’d be a cause I disagree with, but would you be as deferential to high school administrators then ?
as for the topic discussed, i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation ''wipe israel off the map'' is a misquote. < - > The initial quote by the Iranian translator was ''wiped off the map'' and that is what resulted in the notable outcry from world leaders.
You can use coordinate systems and coordinate transformations to translate from one reference frame to another, but they are not the same thing. < - > Once again, frames are equivalence classes of mutually stationary coordinate systems.
No, if you look towards the bottom of the page (in the succession navigation box), where predecessors and successors for any awards, offices, etc one has held or received, you will clearly see that Carol Moseley Braun is his ''predecessor'' and Alexi Gianoulias as his ''successor''. < - > That portion is actually correct, as Carol Moseley Braun was the Democratic nominee for that senate seat in 1998 and lost to Peter Fitzgerald.
I'm not one of the main editors even though I argue here a lot; my content contributions have been very very narrowly focused although I've done a lot of copyediting. < - > Contributing here is surely part of the Wikipedia editing process?

Allusions don't make something significant. < - > I agree with Lucas - those references may not be significant to YOU Mintrick, but they may well be significant to many readers.
But the literature reflects a variety of views on the conceptualisation of atheism. < - > ''This article cannot resolve that variety, only reflect it.'' Yes, ofcourse - but it should reflect it in a manner that emphasizes the consensus position, same as with our other articles, we should not give WP:UNDUE weight to fringe positions, and we should not present them as if they held more currency than the sources available to us indicate.
The fact that a book was published 30 years ago is irrelevant. < - > No, date of publication is not irrelevant.
''44th, and current, President'' might be correct, but your phrasing is as incorrect as ''a tall, and thin man''.-- < - > Your orange stems from the use of a single comma as substitute for the word and between two adjectives, as in changing ''he is a tall and thin man'' to ''he is a tall, thin man''.
It is much longer and omits the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse.Wassupwestcoast, there are some serious flaws in your new rewrite, references numbers 225 and 226 do not support the sentence they reference and number 226 is not a news article, it is an opinion piece which are not OK refs in Wikipedia. < - > I wouldn't emphasize too much the '' the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse'' because there are still new cases coming forward.
However, we are not in the business of weighing the references and pronouncing The Truth®. < - > We weigh the references and produce an article where the majority and minority are given proportional weight not equal weight. This is still not proportional to the amount of sources.

The title was the only problem. < - > The problem was and is that this list does not serve as an explanation of the philosophical concept of a pseudoscience, but as a coatrack for fringe-bashing.

Also the term ''modern'' is entirely POV too in the ''modern'' day the Church has 1,130,000,000 followers, modern people, who by choice of their faith do not agree with killing unborn babies either. < - > The ''Modern challenges faced by the church'' phrasing is good.

In any event both you and I know that the actual policy enacted throughout this period was not relocation - nor was it actually deportation (even if we use such a word for conveinience sake - use of such is actually entirely incorrect). < - > The word ''deportations'' has been used since 1915 in relation to the Armenian genocide; one of the best known document's produced to illustrate the genocide's effects is the map titled ''The Routes of Deportations'' first published back in 1920.
it's like the universal law, Saturday is for slacking off < - > saturday=lecture day.
And at the risk of saying something that really ought to go without saying, Scjessey was absolutely correct to revert Unomi's deletion of the quote. There was no consensus for simply deleting it from the page. < - > I don't see how it's possible to establish a consensus, if Scjessey really thinks that Harris is representing a mainstream view.
Stop blaming students. Better idea? parents &amp;culture stop telling kids that the best way to deal w/a bully is violence. This advice is not only unpractical, but doesn't do anything to build future citizens that obviously can't resolve problems by "punching the guy in the nose!" < - > @JudLounsbury Based on my childhood experience not fighting back against a bully, I have to disagree strongly. The bullies take it as weakness and keep it up. Kids need to stand up for themselves. How that "fighting" happens matters but I eventually did it via wrestling, which worked.

As for your insinuation that a copyright violation occurred, I cannot see how referencing the work of others is a copyright. < - > The latter states, ''If the external work is under standard copyright, then duplicating its text with little, or no, alteration into a Wikipedia article is usually a copyright violation, unless duplication is limited and clearly indicated in the article by quotation marks, or some other acceptable method (such as block quotations)''.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.

I'm tired of hearing that the only reason a person could be pro-Second Amendment is because they're "beholden to the NRA."   Not-so-breaking-news: Many are constitutionalists. Many believe in a natural right to self-defense. Not everyone who disagrees with you is nefarious. < - > @CorieWhalen Labeling viewpoints as nefarious or evil makes it easier to dismiss any valid points w/o any valid points of their own and rallies people to their side via emotional appeal.  "You only disagree with me because &lt;evil&gt;!"  No good defense or rebuttal to that in the court of emotion.
The term waterboarding and the controversy around it revolve around its recent use by the united States government. < - > Yes the term is recent but as you point out the practice itself is old.

Have read the comments of the Leader of the Opposition’s spokesperson. Mr Milne’s comments do not represent the views of the majority of our voters, members or MPs. We’ll get abuse for saying so but where British lives have been put at risk it is important to be clear about this. < - > @ChukaUmunna Clear about what? You have not said what YOU disagree with. You, resolutely, do not speak for the majority of voters, Labour members or MPs. You speak for you and you do it so pointlessly and always.

Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding. At the same time we could do the much needed re-write of the US section now the CIA says it has waterboarded. < - > Look, this article doesn't need to tell the story of how Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was interrogated; he's got his own article, where that information can be found. All this article needs to do is note that ''the U.S.
Those are major issues, and criticism of his positions on those issues is notable.Just off a random google search, something like: Gitmo or Obamacare —Preceding unsigned comment added byThere are two ways to fix the inequality, have no criticisms in any article or have them in both articles. < - > Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative.

An idea many of us cling to, as a means to try find meaning as we maneuver life, it’s also an escape for those who can’t face their truths. In truth, you are God because everything that happens in life, you create it.

Women that are raped and murdered?! Created it RIGHT?! 😳😒
Take notice of the kids who walked out today, in your community. These are the ones you won't want to hire in a few years. They fail at critical thinking, they don't care about the rights of others, they're group-think at its worst, they don't support personal responsibility. < - > @Connectionary Or they simply disagree with you on how to prevent being killed at school.   "Oh my God they're coming for my guns" is group-think at its worst. #NeverAgain #VetsForGunReform
This is not an issue of undue weight, but if anything of systeic bias (and is this case, of systemic bias in the sources). < - > It's undue weight because in historical perspective this is just one example.
Taking a quick look around, I notice that some countries list a category, others list a rank, and others list a number only. < - > They have both category and the actual Gini coefficient next to each other. Bosnia, UK, France, Egypt, Greece, and certainly some more have just the coefficient stated, like the US does, but the vast majority has both (please don't make me calculate percentage :).

Is violence ever the answer? https://t.co/cXmE0rh5UN < - > @AtheistRepublic Physically assaulting someone simply because you disagree with what they say/feel/think is a very dangerous slippery slope that ends with "might makes right." Freedom of Speech and Thought should be sacred to atheists.
I can't prove a the majority of an unbounded set, but I can state that for the set currently available to us the case seems made that the majority of them do support the usage in EBC: ''atheism is a positive denial''. If you wish to argue that EB does not reflect the consensus position then I would have to say that you are making an extraordinary claim that you need to make a case for. < - > You can't maintain that atheism is consensually ''a positive denial'' when Eller, for one, says it isn't a positive denial. Nor have you shown that ''positive denial'' bears the weight placed upon it. EB does not claim to represent a consensus position. It is explicitly Nielsen arguing for a particular position which he regards as a more adequate one.

Sure, but lets not distract ourselves, for the moment - do you agree that you haven't offered a counter to the claim that the contemporary consensus position on atheism is ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'' ? Could you also please clarify what the ''missing context'' for Huxleys agnosticism added to the matter at hand? < - > 1) No, I don't agree. 2) Maybe I'm confused about the ''matter at hand''.
You are trying to promote one particle POV on this subject, which is inappropriate, per Wikipedia policy. < - > Even if we assume you're correct, your argument is of the same form as arguing that electrostatics and magnetism are two sides of the same thing, namely, electromagnetism. Well, yeah. But we still have separate articles on electrostatics and magnetism.
I'm deleting without prejudice unless someone can give me a reason why not. < - > Removing the entire section wasn't a positive move toward change.

Scjessey - Your argument, that ''something written by an apologetic of some brand of theism'' is unreliable, is a specious one. Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism. Indeed, several Wikipedia articles would have to be reduced to a few historical lines using your logic. < - > @DoctorEric - The point I'm trying to make is that a theistic apologist isn't really qualified to offer opinions on atheism.

Getting a lot of criticism for my preference of Dunkirk over The Shape Of Water. Art is subjective and there are no rights and wrongs. That being said I don’t like controversy and am bowing out of discussing film on twitter.   P.S.

If there a number of definitions that define it some other way then those should be there too. < - > I know you can find macroeconomic texts that mention this ''free market'' system, but guess what, we can't just look at those texts because they are not authoritative enough when it comes to the development of capitalism, the history of capitalism, nor the sociological and anthropological dimensions of capitalism. The definition needs to be broad - to match the breadth of the article, which covers the history, etymology and perspectives of capitalism. It isn't an economics textbook. The inclusion of ''free'' narrows the definition so much so as to be exclusionary of major authoritative perspectives (many of which are mentioned further down in the article such as Marx, Weber, Veblen and other major figures).
So we don't trust our own security services and should send a sample of the poison to Russia because we know we can trust theirs.

I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). See WP:MEDRS for guidelines on the sort of sources we'd need for such claims. < - > ''Aspies'' are known for delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking.

Oppose inclusion, per Siafu. Also, if the material is retained, the titles ''Professor'' should be deleted, per WP:CREDENTIAL which says: ''Academic and professional titles (such as ''Doctor'' or ''Professor'') should not be used before the name in the initial sentence or in other uses of the person's name.''. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''.

Perhaps we should just cite it to the 1928 source, in which case we should state the year in the text to alert the reader how long ago it was, or, if we feel the information is outdated, we should delete the sentence. < - > If I were reading the article for the first time, and I jumped down to a footnote that quoted a study from 1928, I would be immediately suspicious of the rest of the article. It's just bad sourcing.
Attacking loss is a loss. Defensive loss is a loss. Talk of "at least we attacked" is the same weak mentality you claim any manager that doesn't always play cavalier football has. No real winner is satisfied with anything less than winning. It is really that simple. < - > @biolakazeem I completely disagree with the notion that @ChelseaFC came to attack at Camp Nou! Capital NO.

Because they're self evidently not the same.
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules. < - > ''It was agreed...'' = Using the passive tense to describe a decision without naming who or when is classic propaganda-speak.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). See WP:MEDRS for guidelines on the sort of sources we'd need for such claims. < - > I know the guidelines. And there are references, so what one might think is or is not out there is irrelevant.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > There are many mechanisms that do, but common descent in not one of them.
However, I do not see why 'highest third', 'lowest quarter' etc. < - > But again: on what basis are you choosing to divide into three parts...rather than into two...or rather than into four...or rather than into five...or rather than into...?
I imagine that what has happened is that in the POV push and pull that plagues articles like this, the information has been shredded by people, much like yourself, who place advocacy before policy and damage content. < - > I am not the one who put in any garbage about occupying regime.

Doing so does not, nor ever has, violate NPOV. < - > An endorsement of LDS theology like this is not acceptable under the WP:NPOV rule.
45 years ago today... https://t.co/jXhCFY9pK2 < - > @SenJohnMcCain I don't always agree with you, but my respect and admiration have never wavered.  Thank you for your service and the example you set each and every day.
I'm deleting without prejudice unless someone can give me a reason why not. < - > The statement - ''the regularity of his initiations had been disputed'' - is a pure fact, and get this: Crowley himself admitted that people disputed his Masonic regularity in his book ''Confessions.'' Note that in the sentence under discussion no attempt is made to discuss the thorny issue of whether an Irregular Masonic body is real Masonic body, or just something that purports to be Masonic.Hence for these reasons, I propose that the original wording should actually stand.
So @LouisFarrakhan is fine with Twitter, but @scrowder gets suspended for comedy routines. @jack, you're making an ass of yourself. #FreeCrowder < - > @benshapiro @LouisFarrakhan @scrowder @jack Easy for Twitter to censor those they disagree with when the definition of racism &amp; bigotry is so broad as to be ridiculous these days. #FreeCrowder .
New Rule: You only get to have an opinion on abortion if you have a vagina.   No vagina=No opinion   #righttochoose #yourbody < - > @ChrisWrightActs Man people are dumb as f@$*!  Woman's body=her choice to do what's best for her. More woman should have a say in policy that affect them. How can anyone disagree?! Hey...don't agree with abortion? Don't fucking have one and how about you adopt a few while you're on your soap box.
Apparently you are also prepared to defend your position that the direct paraphrasing the EB's definition with ''rejection of belief'' (which is also supported by Edwards, as well as by Smith and backed up by numerous dictionaries because of the use of ''disbelief'') must also leave the question of existence closed? < - > First of all, it is very rare that all sources will agree or use the same wording on a subject, no matter what the subject is. Second of all, you have to understand what ''rejection'' actually means, if you reject an offer - does that mean you are leaving the question of accepting the offer open ( leaving out here negotiation tactics )? You may later change your mind and accept it, but that holds true of any position. Same with disbelief, which merriam-webster defines as ''mental rejection of something as untrue''.
Stand up for Free Speech, stand up #ForBritain  https://t.co/ChbBolppRj < - > @AMDWaters anne you should look to your members in your facebook group they don't seem to believe in free speech. free speech means defending people who you don't agree with.
At the beginning of the war when Poland was invaded, the allies originally consisted of: Australia, British India, Canada, France, Poland, New Zealand, Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom. < - > No.
You also continue to be wrong and, as far as I can tell, are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position. < - > Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.
brushes are sooo much better at lint removal than rollers < - > @pr0xiii I strongly disagree with this statement.
Currently, I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA, that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote. < - > Descibe the creed in terms of its importance to the faith.
Christy Moore gave up his support of the IRA in 1987 due to the slaughter in Enniskillen.   The BBC is not ‘the UK state broadcaster’ , that’s a stupid thing to say.   The Birmingham Six were the victims of a heinous conspiracy by UK police  The IRA let them rot in jail. https://t.co/SaUj4lAiW3 < - > @Gri64 I don't disagree with your first and third points at all. The conspiracy went beyond the police as I say in the article,  and as for the IRA (whoever they were) it was not within their gift to have them released.
Remembering Stephen Hawking's perfect opinion on IQ https://t.co/CNXNbTelZ5 < - > @MarkWallaceGlos Having an above average IQ of 150. I have to say i disagree. Obviously as my IQ is a 150 i must be correct 😉
Russia’s actions cannot be tolerated. Proportionate but firm response right. Support PM’s initial actions, though future legislation will require careful scrutiny. Key point - Russia cannot unlawfully kill/attempt to kill on our streets with impunity. < - > @NicolaSturgeon I'd rather there was proof before taking any retaliatory action. *SNP member, still SNP member, no intention of flouncing off in a huff just because I disagree with this one statement.*

Two recently added images include a dead dog, which I find random and in somewhat bad taste, and an image of the pope, along with caption making POV assertions about his entrance to the 'afterlife'. < - > The Dog is clearly the best illustration of death put forth so far imho, the pope one is indeed POV.
It's been explained to you more than once. < - > You haven't addressed the argument above at all.
Why is Wikipedia still referring to the Island of Ireland and the Island of Britain as the ''British Isles''. Ireland is not British, it never was British and never will be British so to call it British is, one, and insult to Ireland and it's people and two, politically incorrect. < - > ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ No, it's not the common name; the common name (albeit controversial to some) is ''British Isles''.
But when we are trying to present a picture of waterboarding as a general practice it does not make sense to have more than half of the article be examples from the last five years about the US military. < - > It's inevitable that most of this article is going to be about the recent use of waterboarding by the U.S.
Ironically, alongside world censorship day, @Google, in an effort “protect” consumer wellbeing, officially declared the banning of #cryptocurrency related ads. This foreshadowing news leaves me concerned yet relieved that @SubstratumNet exists. < - > @IAMZAZ @SubstratumNet @Google While I disagree with blanket bans, most #crypto phishing hacks were from google ads. Hopefully in the future @Google will re-evaluate to allow well intentioned crypto ads back in place but for now I regard it as an overall positive move #bitcoin #cryptocurency
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts, which is not criticism at all. < - > I never said that we should include negative facts for the sake of including them.
It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
What a great thread! Top 3 takeaways: 1. Make the offer signing process very serious. Contracts, NDA, penalty for not joining. via @anuj 2.

Give a laptop the moment they accept via @prabirkaushik https://t.co/r8PjE6JKOy < - > @aakuvaish @anuj @PrashantPansare @prabirkaushik Disagree.

Basque is, indeed, the only language still spoken in Europe that predates the arrival of the Indo-European languages. < - > Dumu, I'm not sure how you figure we can't say with a fair amount of certainty it's pre-IE.

The Gaza population density is 4118/km2 which is ranked the 2nd densest urban area in the world. < - > Compared to other cities and urban areas around the world, there's nothing special about Gaza.
Heard Faisal sabzwari for the first time on television. Absolutely loved the way he talks. < - > @_rabiamohd Most of the MQM people talk cool, eloquently no doubt, though you can disagree with their political views.
This implies the mindset that it's some external force influencing them, that they need to just pray against it or something. < - > It carries a different implication when an exorcist says it, though.
GAP employs 160,000, are they all suddenly not allowed to update this article? < - > Not when they're paid to.
Anybody got a critique of Jordan Peterson that doesn't come from a materialist perspective? Like a pro-Jung, anti-Peterson take? < - > Full disclosure: I am enjoying many of the points here.

It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > Just to remind that in archive 8 part 14 and 15 we discussed already the word ''terrorism'' and it was clear that the majority support it.
We have had such a picture for a quite a while now. < - > It's not equivalent to a photograph or even a basic diagram.
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > No, it hasn't been agreed upon by all users yet.
Lost a lot of respect for datsik today... been listening to you for 8 years now and you go and pull some fucked up shit like this?

Impunity may allow ODM to remove @Wetangulam as minority leader. But more importantly, ODM must first make up her mind whether she is in Jubilee's government or not. For if she is, then by law, she MUST forfeit PAC/PIC &amp; minority leadership in both houses to ANC, Wiper &amp; FORD K. < - > @KBonimtetezi @Wetangulam On this I disagree Mheshimiwa. The positions of Majority and Minority leadership are not to do with government or opposition (not even in the constitution) but about numbers in the House. As long as @TheODMparty remains, it deserves the position of Minority leader @BelAkinyii
''Just for the record'', the tag removal was accompanied in one instance by a major re-write of the article that removed all controversial material. That removal was instigated by PeR. In the second case, the reasons for placing the tag weren't presented, and the removal of the tag was accompanied by an explanation that was not contested. < - > Brews ohare's statements above are incorrect.
Sometimes people complain too much on what’s going on in WWE like it’s really gonna make a difference (myself included). Just watch and enjoy the product. Don’t enjoy it then don’t watch it. < - > @434CLUB I agree and disagree. Yes there are things we can't change and most of the times I just watch and don't complain but as fans we have the right to ask for something new,fresh  and different.
Wassap, I don't see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short. < - > There are still unresolved POV issues, issues with the writing and non-encyclopedic tone, reference and sourcing issues, and notable controversies glossed over and/or ignored.--
I thoroughly enjoyed it, less for the whinging and more for the astute observations of Hollywood culture. < - > I don't know...I don't feel like it's so astute to point out that the Oscars are kind of pompous and out of touch.

The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs. < - > However, I am not convinced that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
Actually, it is not describing the Creed (it is the Creed). < - > Descibe the creed in terms of its importance to the faith.
I don't remember the last time I used this degrading word to describe a woman.....but Joy is a BITCH https://t.co/FBjuYpXGGk < - > @TexDolly I totally disagree. We need MORE people to stand up and fight against what should be known as “utter nonsense” (religion).
Remember that time Larry Kudlow  said Trump has "never been good on trade"  That was 12 days ago https://t.co/vfqaAXKp4j < - > @gelles @vplus Besides all the other things I said about you you won't last long because you don't agree with Trump a hundred percent so say bye-bye when you get a chance
I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise). < - > ''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.
I am aware of the need for references, hence my suggestion the literature be culled. < - > I don't think speculating on someone would be useful, re: Einstien.
I liked Case as well. In my opinion think Cousins is a rare QB to hit the market and believe in him. High risk, high reward. https://t.co/EwjT8sDHvW < - > @SkolBros Interesting that you say that. Respectfully disagree. I think cousins' whole appeal is he's safe. Lower risk and lower reward. Consistent above average guy, not a top tier guy imo. Both are good reasons to sign him, so it's interesting to see the opposite sides of it
And threatening to put this on the blacklist just doesn't make sense. < - > I've blacklisted this based on the abuse, not the stuff above that gets people hot under the collar.
I think the sentence is good the way it is; it shows that the church, while believing itself to be the ''one true church'', also wants to work with others on common goals/for unity. < - > I would suggest no, and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section.
No one (save reality show stars) become famous/notable for their personal lives-its trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia. < - > I disagree that ''Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY.'' While no one, except mostly reality show stars, become famous/notable for their personal lives, I do not believe that it's trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia.
I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic (which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal, we lose several important wikilinks too. < - > It contains the same information, but is summarized so it does not have the details of the persecution of Catholics.
Oppose - This is clearly undue weight to the fringe journals, so it shouldn't be included in the article. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
Certainly, a lot of the Mahāyāna literature was written in reaction to what the authors considered to be heterodoxy and blasphemy. < - > Certainly Madhyamaka, the foundation of Mahayana, was a reaction to Abhidharma and a return to the Buddha's message. I'm pretty sure that is consensus among scholars. There was an academic book on this.
Fake people have an image to maintain. Real people just don't care. < - > @neverknownfacts I disagree
Because nobody has a decent answer for the addition of some approval numbers, but the omission of others, I'm going to add the following sentence (which is properly sourced) As of August 2010, Rasmussen polls found that the total percent of approval was 44%, while the total percent of disapproval was 55%. < - > Disputed, so no consensus.
Conor Lamb’s win in #PA18 proves that Trumpism is dying. The only person who doesn’t know this is Trump himself. < - > @EdKrassen Disagree. I think the win is fantastic but the numbers were too close. There are still people that are dedicated to the orange psycho. IMO we can't get cocky if we're going to win back the WH...if he's not impeached by then 🤞
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead. < - > Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas.
Philosophical discussions will often lack (or include bias-selected) empirical data -- I could cite examples within this very article -- but that doesn't make them ''unreliable'' or unworthy of inclusion. < - > Prominent atheists like Harris, Russel etc are perfectly suitable for the subject matter of this article.
I hate the phrase "PC culture" &amp; the (insult?) snowflake, which at the end just means embracing individuality &amp; accepting that some people aren't exactly alike, but nonetheless still deserve the same treatment... BUT the bad rep we get by association is deserved. < - > Disagree with me or change my mind, @ me even or whatever, but I can tell a story about my day of cleaning up my yard after a *PERSON* rummaged through our dumpsters and made a mess of the entire block without being called out for assuming he was homeless.
As Xandar has stated that were are a million priests (if not more) and surely if one looked hard enough you would find a plethora of sin amongst them. < - > One does not need to look hard to find reliable recent articles detailing the trouble of the Catholic church worldwide as an organization rather than as a collection of a few sinful individuals.Cheers!

Nah. Sorry. I disagree. This is an answer from someone privileged with beauty. Telling people that confidence is the answer to every impediment is just being lazy, and sugarcoating the harsh truth that some people are just not conventionally beautiful. https://t.co/YkGiTpIMdK < - > @_mohammadaidil_ But beauty or appearance preference are subjective per person, which we all can just agree and disagree since it fits/far off from our conceptions.

I could provide counterexamples, like the Encyclopedia of Philosophy: On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. < - > I should also note that ''rejects'' is increasingly, it seems, becoming a term of art where the usage in scholarly works on philosophy is not the same as the lay reading allows - certainly if the lay reading entertains the notion that it is not expressing a certainty about a proposition.
I am not sure what would be the best word - however ethnic cleansing (though not my favorite phrase) perhaps describes the intent of the actions and uprooting (from homes/villages etc) also somewhat describes at least the portion regarding the removal of persons and forced (death) marches pretty much describes what occured from there on out. < - > ''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide?
Tea Party Republicans should have a wp article. < - > No need for any different article, but the title might lend itself to decreasing the confusion of this article.
#resist is pure sedition and should be punished accordingly. Legal protest is one thing; conspiracy to depose elected officials and commit street violence against political opposition, quite another. Jail them all on sight. < - > @themagaist @rickyha38401941 No one wants to depose elected officials, and the street violence is almost non-existent (although it does, rarely, happen on both sides).  You can’t arrest and punish people just because you disagree with them, man.

My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > Single version Dual version We should stay with the single CoA, as Wales & Northern Ireland are within the United Kingdom aswell.

I think it's fair to say that neither is ''better'', but it's interesting to see the way the different approaches go. < - > I could see having such rendering for a print-based application, Word or something, but for a web browser, which is [i]not[/i] meant to go on paper, I think it's a terrible idea.
So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct. < - > No.

Actually, it mostly discusses CIA or American use during the Bush years (although now not mostly referring to him by name); the others are mentioned either historically or almost en passant as other repressive regimes. < - > I would reduce the amount of time this article deals with recent US waterboarding by removing the ''Controversy over classification as torture in the United States'' as well as ''As a political issue in confirmation hearings'' and ''As a political issue in 2008 presidential election''.
PUBG is still better < - > @PostMalone I have to disagree bud. But it's almost even. Exept for the fact that fortnite battle royal is free.
An actual, not figurative, LOL. The hallmark of a deranged conspiracy theorist is that all evidence, including evidence that negates the theory, is instantly converted into further proof of it.

There's a clear timeline here, and while it's not definitive evidence, it certainly reeks of their influence. Within DAYS of the Exxon deal being officially cancelled Tillerson gets the axe.

Can a Democrat please run against this horrible human and get him out of the state House? < - > @DGComedy @lovella1975 @Emma4Change Republicans just can't get away from using insults when talking about anyone or any group that disagree with them or have differing ideas! If this is governing our Democracy is in trouble!
Third, it employs a mathematical manipulation POV (shuffling terms) that is very unreal and intuitively phony. < - > That's not a valid criticism, because the very subject of this article is fictitious forces in rotating reference frames, and these are explicitly defined as the result of ''shuffling terms'' (as you put it).
Have read the comments of the Leader of the Opposition’s spokesperson. Mr Milne’s comments do not represent the views of the majority of our voters, members or MPs. We’ll get abuse for saying so but where British lives have been put at risk it is important to be clear about this. < - > @ChukaUmunna You disagree that we should seek the evidence and follow international law on this occasion?   I am a constituent of yours and a Lab party member and I find this highly troubling - this kind of arrogance led to Iraq being invaded on an entirely false premise.
I have removed the remaining insignificant examples. < - > I think you have done a good work, but IMO ''Cultural references'' section was cleaned up a bit too much.--
So we don't trust our own security services and should send a sample of the poison to Russia because we know we can trust theirs. Have I got this right, Corbyn disciples? < - > @mrjamesob Don’t disagree that we need to go through due process with OPCW so that we have a legally sound basis for taking action. Issue is that the delivery was typical arseholeish Corbyn - tone deaf and smug. But both sides have made this partisan rather than Nat interest.

#Parkland student has respectful, productive meetings with Murphy, Schumer, Speaker Ryan, Hatch, Cruz, First Lady &amp; the President in the Oval Office! But barely a mention anywhere by any of the #Florida newspaper writers? Or by most in national press? I wonder why??? < - > @marcorubio It's funny how conservatives think. One kid that actually ages with you should represent their school. 3 percent of scientists disagree about humans causing global warming, etc. You guys should give up politics and pursue a career in Cherry picking.

Tommy Robinson ‘Forced by Police to Leave Speakers’ Corner Ahead of Free Speech Talk’   https://t.co/zB6HH0KWxN < - > @BreitbartLondon I don't agree with Tommy that the total banning of free speech in Britain is because our rotten treacherous politicians are scared of muslim reaction.   Instead, it is because the AGENDA of UK politicians is GLOBALIST:  to flood Britain with millions of muslims to Islamify it.
Here's an example of the kind of introduction that I think would be appropriate, accurate, and NPOV for the current article. < - > I think the old intro should be used instead, and that can link to the two different articles that explain the different uses.

@JuliaLopezMP - As a constituent of yours I'm increasingly concerned about the over-reaching of counter-terrorism laws to suppress freedom of speech in the UK [...] https://t.co/kFy57FN2u5 < - > @JuliaLopezMP - To be clear. I don't agree with the opinions that these three people hold but I don't believe it warrants banning entry. The UK needs to use counter-terrorism legislation to prevent terrorism and not to suppress free speech. Your thoughts would be welcome.
Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes'' 1 he has signed in to law a tax on tanning, as well as buying cigarettes (which are bought overwhelmingly by people making less than 250,000) 2 These facts should be mentioned, I think, because they have caused some controversy among his opponents, and some supporters alike.Long story short: We'll know he raised taxes on under $250,000s if and only if a reliable source says he did. < - > while technically true, I never, for one minute, believed he was including sin taxes in that too.

The Last Thing Bernie Sanders Needs Right Now Is A Conversation About Guns  https://t.co/L2RhHuHQbl < - > @VABVOX He supports people rising up for what they believe. I don't agree with him on all issues but I agree big on that and respect he doesn't have public and private positions.
Consider bread production in the U.S. That's a free market. The government doesn't tell the producers how much to produce and what to charge. In other words, it's ''unregulated.'' The government doesn't regulation production and consumption. That is, bread market is a free market. There is no such thing as a capitalist system where there are no free markets. The distinguishing characteristic is free markets. < - > Take an authorative historian of capitalism and you'll see that capitalism most certainly exists without free markets. Even your bread market is regulated for food safety, quality control, price subsidies to farmers and so on - far from ''free''. But let's say that even if a free market could exist, it doesn't mean that we should make the definition of capitalism so narrow that it excludes cases where markets are regulated or ''interfered in'' by the state.
Corbyn has denounced Russia publicly many times. He's denounced the human rights abuses, the economic corruption, the political corruption.

Both right < - > @StarWarsJunk @MentorSkywalker Respectfully, I disagree.  I love a great story and interesting characters.

Brews, there seems to be something wrong about your remark that: ''The point is that the most common viewpoint and the one basic to the view of such texts as Taylor and of Arnol'd and of Landau and Lifshitz and of Whittiker is the one based upon centrifugal forces that vanish in a non-rotating frame, and are present in a rotating frame. < - > Hi Harald: There are two approaches to handling rotating frames.

Second, because a regime can change and the entity remains (exactly as MA points out in his comparable example - the Shah regime of iran'' < - > But saying that the zionist regime and the zionist entity are distinct is wrong.
I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''. < - > Again, all fictitious forces are ''coordinate based'', so it makes no sense to call some of them ''coordinate based'' and others ''state of motion based''. That is simply a novel narrative that you have personally fabricated, not supported by any reputable sources, and as such it doesn't belong in Wikipedia.

Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama's biography, but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not. This section should be cut down to two or three sentences at the most. < - > I'm not saying what I wrote can't be improved upon, I'm saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter, if it then makes it lopsided, is not the answer here.And to Wikidemon's already beginning editing, regardless of the colloquial use of their former name, they are not actually called ''British Petroleum''.
There are also little wording issues like The hostile criticisms of the Reformation which insert a subtle POV. < - > I'm sorry Karanacs, I disagree with your proposal.
Crucial to understanding this article is this sentence from the 2nd paragraph.: ''This article will start with what have been some widely accepted, but still in various ways mistaken or misleading, definitions of atheism and move to more adequate formulations that better capture the full range of atheist thought and more clearly separate unbelief from belief and atheism from agnosticism.'' That crucial sentence thus also applies to other things he has said in the very 1st paragraph, such as: ''Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not, professing to find the questions unanswered or unanswerable.'' that crucial sentence also specifically says '' and more clearly separate... atheism from agnosticism'' It is also worth noting that while saying they are distinguished, he does not really yet say HOW they are distinguished - he just gives a general description of agnosticism.-- < - > Sorry JimWae, but it is difficult to express just how extraordinary a claim that is without seeming insulting.

How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today. In recent years, abuse of minors by representatives of the Catholic church made headlines throughout the world, further tarnishing the church's image.'' < - > That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion, contraception and euthanasia though, which I feel is important to point out if we're going to directly address those issues. It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought.
You're just trying to give undue weight to your interpretation of this particular topic. < - > I'm specifically trying NOT to give undue weight to any particular view of the subject.
Safaricom has CONSISTENTLY abused its dominant position in the market to offer below quality services while stifling competition through unfair practises.

However, as far as I know, the negotiations between Britain and the USSR (and later the US) were not about Soviet entry into some existing alliance (no such am alliance existed by that moment), but about the formation of new alliance (''The Grand Alliance''). < - > It seems uncontroversial to say that 'The USSR joined the Allies' - the 'Allies' of World War II were a temporary grouping which wasn't centred around formal treaties.
Of course Bevel is co-equal to Dr. < - > For the moment, the available sources clearly indicate that historians simply do not consider him a ''first-tier leader of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement'' on or close to par with King.
The Marleau ref discusses provincial politics, and the sentence I moved it from already has two other refs supporting it. The 1983 ref is outdated, and its information is already covered by the other two refs covering the same information. The GG ref covers the information from both of the refs it replaces, neither of which were particularly vital. < - > I do not see how removing those perfectly good references serves any purpose.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose The edit conflict seems to be between a small group, who are trying to give fringe sources parity with reliable ones, and a larger group determined to maintain the distinction between the two. The consensus seems clear to me; I don't think ''consensus'' is synonymous with ''unanimity.''--
Consensus doesn't mean that everyone has to agree, it simply means that the majority of quality sources do. < - > You have also failed to establish that the EB article represents a ''consensus'' view as opposed to the particular conceptualisation of one particular writer.
And, also indirect ownership such as a loan from a bank results in profit going to the bank and those that supplied the money to purchase the means of production (and distribution). < - > I do draw the line on your second point, though. A bank loan is not ''indirect ownership''. It is debt, not equity, there is no claim of ownership, indirect or otherwise. The bank receives interest, not profit - although that interest is indeed deducted from the profit that would otherwise go to the capital owners.
Govt is right to take action to dismantle Russian intelligence capability in UK, to agree now to the Magnitsky amendment, and to work through UN to expose Russia for deeply serious breaches of international law, chemical weapons prohibition &amp; human rights. < - > @YvetteCooperMP I disagree with you on just about everything, but the stance of you and your colleagues on this is admirable, welcome and badly needed.
2) The term Second lady is seldom used in the press today. < - > 2: I don't know why your Lexis search failed to find usage of the term ''second lady'', but I was immediately able to find recent usage of this title like: I particularly like her May 30th, 2005 interview with Larry King, where Mrs.
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ What ''dangers'' of atheism? < - > Scjessey - Your argument, that ''something written by an apologetic of some brand of theism'' is unreliable, is a specious one. Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism. Indeed, several Wikipedia articles would have to be reduced to a few historical lines using your logic.
Well, that wasn't unconstructive! Constructive discussion: WP:TALK via [ [47]]. < - > No legitimate suggestions of article improvement, just hand-wringing about ''liberals'' and SAT scores.I find it all over Wikipedia, but especially in the political arena, whether it's a politician or a political commentator or whatnot.
"People seem to forget that we're kids who just went through a traumatic experience." FL school shooting survivor Lewis Mizen bemoans politician's insults of classmate Emma Gonzalez, noting students have been attacked for "using our First Amendment rights" https://t.co/tlrG7TD2T8 https://t.co/I9kqD6hy3k < - > @CNN These students have every right to speak their opinions. But the rest of America has toe right to disagree and criticize their views and conclusions if we disagree. That’s how the first amendment works.
Hey freinds in Maine! Who wants to run against this hate loving politician he's is running UNOPPOSED RUN AGAINST HIM I don't care what party JUST DO IT. https://t.co/vRR7p1ZHKf < - > @davidhogg111 @keithandreen “Friends”, David. “Friends”. Settle down, buddy...and probably wouldn’t hurt to throw in a hyphen between “hate” &amp; “loving, as well (i.e. “hate-loving”).  I get it. Kind of lame when folks name-call &amp; make false accusations against other people they disagree with, doesn’t it? 😐
It is a violation of WP:SYNTH, as well as a logical fallacy known as poisoning the well. < - > There is no SYNTH, as the reference is to Israel making precisely the same charge made against another paramilitary group.
So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other? < - > First, I note again your non-response to the substantive question (which perhaps is just as well, considering that your previous response gives ample evidence of your level of understanding of this subject). Second, for the billionth time, you are entitled to pass judgement on what is ''normal'', and wikipedia policy is NOT to limit articles to just the ''most common'' point of view, but to represent all notable points of view to be found in reputable sources. Hence your comments are completely misguided.
Currently there are listed a wealth of sources which seem to support that atheism is indeed dogmatic - no matter if some people may have called themselves atheists without understanding what the word actually meant. < - > Or, indeed, ''no matter'' if some people may have called other people atheists without understanding what the word actually meant.
Confrontational implies attitude and having a bone to pick, when sometimes just saying the truth  is effective enough. < - > Well...normally I think of confrontational as in...someone has a problem with me and rather than let it exist, I do something about it (for better or worse).
High quality sourcing is available on this topic, so WP:Parity doesn't apply, and per WP:DUE, including a paragraph from fringe astrological journals in equal size to our summary of Nature is inappropriate. < - > You are right in the sense that ''Astrologers disagree'' with Carlson's conclusions - though that statement invites the comment - they would, wouldn't they? The case for the criticisms of Carlson is stronger than that. If you follow the threads you will see that in this instance, two of the psychology professors Eysenck and Ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write ''Scientists disagree...'' or ''Psychologists disagree ...''.
A lot of pettiness on the right.  Here's 1 example.   You make a video, send it to a Conservative publication, they ignore it.  Someone else copies the video you made &amp; your tactic &amp; then the ppl who you sent your video to cover the other video instead.  The right is not united. < - > @LauraLoomer I was just having this convo after some serious Twitter drama involving #maga folks last night.  The Left is like glue. Sadly, we're held together by spit. Pettiness, jealousy &amp; if we have ANY areas we disagree, we can't agree to do so, and stand fast. We block &amp; malign. Not good

Whether it's claiming George Soros is paying protesters, or saying a student-conceived, student-led day of national protest is an insidious liberal scam, the right just can't believe anyone would stick their neck out for someone other than themselves https://t.co/WUOrW9jZca < - > @AndyRichter With respect, I disagree. The right's campaign has been built around othering and fear. The prospect of teenagers, a group already considered pretty alien by adults, organising something like this in such a way as to offer no adult real access, well that engenders fear.
Teen goes viral after posting about being only student to walk out https://t.co/JuB4nyrjaO https://t.co/YiG2bUODJz < - > @thehill THIS went viral? I don’t disagree with the kid, but this is worthy of the term viral? “Check it out. I’m out in front of my school.” FFS people get a life.

#OHGov candidate @RichCordray fought to allow guns at the Statehouse. #OHGov candidate @Dennis_Kucinich is fighting to keep guns out of our classrooms.

You can't shut down speech you don't agree with because you don't agree with it and, yes, marching around with guns is speech.   Good lord, people.
Single version Dual version We should stay with the single CoA, as Wales & Northern Ireland are within the United Kingdom aswell. < - > You've lost me GoodDay; N.Ireland and Wales are represented on both sets of arms and neither (currently) have a version of UK arms specific to them, unlike Scotland.
🔥 Watch @mariacaulfield destroy @UKLabour for not telling the truth about free school meals🔥 https://t.co/APpzEgODrk < - > @Conservatives @mariacaulfield @UKLabour I don't disagree with the first two comments, the last one is disengenuous though. It's by 2020 and it still means that children currently in line for free meals in later years will not get them.

During the National School Walkout, a student at New Prague High School in Minnesota held a sign that said: “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.”  A student at the school said, "he was escorted off the property by our principal &amp; threatened to be put into a police car." https://t.co/1V6eaL0eRi < - > @RealSaavedra @KurtSchlichter Kid should have realized that #SchoolWalkOuts are only permissible if it follows the @NEAToday liberal agenda. Disagree with me? Give me an example otherwise - #EducateDontIndoctrinate BTW, New Prague HS National Ranking is a joke. https://t.co/z6IT3AFFHC
Peter was wrong: Managers do not rise to the level of their incompetence, not in this Administration.   Rick Perry may be leaving the Energy Department, an agency he wanted to abolish and didn’t understand, only to lead Veterans Affairs. “Oops” doesn’t begin to cover it. < - > @RepAdamSchiff I disagree "Oops" &amp; a shrug pretty much sums up everything Rick Perry attempts to do...  Trump would move a guy that didn't understand the 1st job he was given &amp; was still learning- into a new one to learn &amp; then screw up. Except it's our veterans.
We shouldn't ''whitewash'' the article just because some things may be controversial. < - > I was attempting to answer what appeared to be a genuine question from a first-time poster without making incendiary remarks, not ''whitewashing'' anything.
Murray has 13 PL goals this season &amp; has been excellent. He offers #ENG something different - good strength &amp; can hold the ball up.   Welbeck has three goals in 20 games, hasn’t played much this season &amp; is bang average.   Welbeck is in the England squad &amp; Murray isn’t.. 🙈🙈💩💩 < - > @SamEllard I doubt Welbeck would be in the squad if Kane was fit. Unfortunately now we're at the point where uncapped players won't have a chance of going to Russia unless they were in this squad. If Southgate had no plans for Murray, no point selecting him. Don't agree, but I get it
The only reason why atheists do not like Christianity this day in age is the supposed moral restrictions. Nothing at all with scientific set backs. < - > @ArkadyChoi not true, in america christians try to put their religious beliefs in schools, their symbols on public property and disparage those that don't agree with them
Must-read @WSJ: "Trade Agreements Are the Answer to Trade Deficits" https://t.co/kUqviTwdXA < - > @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Why do you claim to be a republican?  You obviously are a democrat and I’m sure focusing on your illness is a lot more important than making every effort to disagree with EVERYRHING @realDonaldTrump says. I’m sure you’ve made the history books, so go enjoy your family
While AIDS is frightening, I don't think that it needs any assistance in being more frightening. < - > If you're suggesting that the tone of the current article is fear-mongering, then I disagree.

Also, alt-RIGHT republican should had passes it 2.
If I was a college math professor I’d make every single homework answer be 69 and every test question answer 420 just to fuck with the kids. < - > I had a high school teacher who gave us five possible answers to each question, 1) Fully Agree 2) Strongly Agree 3) No Opinion 4) Strongly Disagree 5) Fully Disagree. “Strongly Agree/Disagree” were the ways to answer but he didn’t tell anyone until after the test. So dumb.
As a courtesy in the future, please share your sources rather than simply delete material. < - > I don't know why you claim I'm providing citations, when they have already been pointed out.
I hate that Donald Trump was in the public consciousness for so long before becoming POTUS because he’s referenced in movies and shows that I love and it makes me ill https://t.co/vPin3fvfzp < - > @AccioAwesome Trump is a failure and must be stopped. Part of doing this is learning to talk to those we disagree with. Take a look at this documentary about millions of Americans like you struggling to maintain hope: https://t.co/NioQ1F5K4t ^EM
I think it's fair to say that neither is ''better'', but it's interesting to see the way the different approaches go. < - > I understand the point, but I think Apple's ''making the fonts look nice'' make the fonts look terrible.
Please don't get angry. Get your PVC. Let's vote out President Muhammadu Buhari @MBuhari and his incompetence the way we voted out former President Jonathan and his incompetence.  They can then compare notes on incompetence at their expense not at ours https://t.co/WOGEeubIM3 < - > @AishaYesufu @MBuhari I disagree. Chibok girls were kidnapped April 2014, clueless Jonathan visited military formations in North east 6 weeks to the elections 2015 in military uniform..not the Govt sec school Chibok. PMB has visited Dapchi school few weeks after he deployed FG delegations and IG. https://t.co/9MKbvVAZ9N
If you care about some random, self-named person posting an obscure stream on a platform most don't use and setting streaming records for doing absolutely nothing of substance...it may be time to reexamine priorities. < - > @WillReeveJr You very well may be right about the longevity of the platform, unless Amazon and Twitch have anything to say about it. But "substance" is subjective. And whether they last for a year or 100, the millions of people using it daily would disagree about its importance --- TO THEM
Am I too forward? < - > too forward?
Really surprised about all these veteran running backs getting deals. When you take a look at the entire landscape, it's going to be hard to find large workhorse-type roles for the running backs in this draft class. < - > @MikeTagliereNFL Disagree. Point to Vikes and Latavius Murray signing, even though they invested, more than happy to hand the keys over to Dalvin Cook before injury. Teams just value having depth.
no, its a system of supple and demand. < - > But you seem confused between capitalists and landlords. Different roles, different earnings. A landlord can charge rent even if he did not put an ounce of work into the place. Just the mere fact of ownership of limited land. Look up the concept of ''rent''.
Ok so twitter just locked my account &amp; forced me to delete this tweet https://t.co/Xwyggl276b < - > @TRobinsonNewEra Not sure if you've heard this but Islam is actually a religion of peace, so much so that if you disagree we will silence you until compliance.
Either the basis of this whole article is at risk or Darwinism is a valid entry. < - > The basis of this article is not at risk.
Rock, like Shut Up And Drive and Rihanna says the next album will be more Rock and Punk < - > Just because shut up and drive has rock influences does not generalize her into being a rock singer.

I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise). < - > ''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.
Here's an example of the kind of introduction that I think would be appropriate, accurate, and NPOV for the current article. < - > I object strenuously to your proposal and have given my reasons, which you pooh-pooh as misguided and as already dealt with by your snow job of vague allusions to wonderful arguments made in the distant past, with refutations blithely ignored.
Amazing to me how you can say this in agreement re: Randle while crushing Kanter at will lol. https://t.co/ioDUtf4uoj < - > @ThomasCDee Kanter and KP does not work.  If you think KP won't come back but we should build around Kanter then fine, I don't agree however.
I’m about to speak to @alicrew on @ABCNewsradio about Peter Dutton’s  visa offer to South African white farmers. SPOILER ALERT: I think he’s racist or criminally naive. Or both. < - > @StephenGrootes @alicrew @ABCNewsRadio I disagree. You need to get a perspective on what outsiders think of SA. My experience is that the pervading view is that SA is a slowly building catastrophe. And it not Afriforum contributing to this view.
And there's nothing wrong with being a ''narrow-minded, ignorant bigot''. < - > There is EVERYTHING wrong with being a bigot.
They're proud of it, in fact.Israel did everything possible to avoid civilian casualties, but it can't be 100% accurate when fighting against terrorists hiding among the civilian population. < - > The fact that Israel dropped bombs on civilian areas in one of the most densely populated regions of the world is overwhelming evidence that the intent was to kill civilians.
My favorite one is the "we aren't having it" one. https://t.co/qlCbw81sC4 < - > @amazingatheist I don't agree that old Lara Croft was "a sexist, over-the-top cartoon character in the initial version of the game" just cause she was busty doesn't make her sexist. She was a cartoonish over the top character perhaps but giving her big boobs isn't sexist.
“It’s time to address the elephant in the room: Influencers don’t really influence anything or anyone!” https://t.co/gFGwTvmxEP < - > @jeremywaite @faris i disagree. perhaps it's the topic or level of influence, but influencers can genuinely drive traffic + conversation for products/events (consumer facing things). they're not effective when it comes to making significant cultural impacts, but that's not their purpose.
Close - but ''God exists'' is not what is being sought a referent for, God is, and reference failure isn't ''can be neither true or false'', that is the property that it has for not referring to anything. < - > Once again, the referent that has not been obtained is the one for ''God'', not God.--
“Please get your” — and here she used an expletive — “together or we will all die,” she tweeted https://t.co/usFEQCbl5H < - > @nytimes I don't disagree with her.....
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article.
Black Ops 4 will be a total loss unless CoD permanently goes back to boots on the ground. < - > @ssquiidd Umm, I’m going to strongly, strongly disagree with that. Bo3 was one of the best call of duty’s to exist, @Treyarch always kills Black Ops call of duty series
I simply propose adding 200 words that reflect Lederer's article, which is cited at length on the Denialism page, so how controversial can it be? < - > Sorry Martindo, the talk page is the precise place to float a controversial change, not the article itself.
With the U.S. Treasury Department now issuing sanctions directly related to Robert Mueller's investigation, it makes it nearly impossible for Trump to justify firing Mueller.  If he does, then he is impeding upon the best interests of the United States! < - > @EdKrassen Disagree. I think he is going to use it as part of the pretext for shutting Mueller down.  The old strategy was deny anything happened.  New strategy is, yes the Russians interfered, but no collusion, see House intelligence cmte, and now we punished them, so game over.
Emphasizing private ownership of capital is hardly glorifying; indeed, it is Marx's number one point. < - > As for private property, I disagree with Marx, changing which entity legally owns the means of production does not necessarily change the underlying mode of production. The PRC's or Singapore's large state sectors are evidence enough of this, although they are publicly owned, they still operate for a profit and often reinvest this profit into the economy, the wage-system (which Marx considered to be a defining feature of capitalism) still remains in place as workers are still exploited in the Marxian sense (China is described as capitalist or state capitalist by non-socialist and non-Marxist commentators and political scientists).

I swear the way some people criticize others beats my understanding...   And then how are you gonna give a someone compliment and then say something offensive, like "aww,shes sweet but shes blonde and damn" because she doesnt talk about the things you want to hear.. < - > If you dont agree with something that someone else is doing or saying, then just dont comment, cos then it makes you just seem really ignorant...
Left with the stories fed by the poor quality media coverage, many Americans were mistakenly led to believe that Terry was ''brain dead,'' in a coma, or in a ''persistive vegetative state.'' If the media had covered Terri's plight the way they did the aftermath of Katrina, perhaps she would have had a bit of a fighting chance. < - > A fighting chance?
The argument about authors being able to get ''their objections published in equally respected journals'' has been addressed a few times here and as stated in WP:PARITY ''Parity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia'' This is the case with research into astrology, not because of the quality of the research or the credentials of the researchers but the nature of the subject. < - > That's not correct, Robert. There are a number of reliable secondary sources that could be used instead.
So Rand Paul will vote against Trump's pick for Secretary of state and CIA? This is why a lot of Republican voters aren't showing up at the voting booths. They are sick and tired of this. Going against Trump only serves to injure the party. Rand Paul must go. enough is enough < - > @1776Stonewall Rand has no other platform but to disagree! It seems that's the only way he can get media attention. Pompeo is the best choice for SOS, should be a shoo-in for the job! Gina is the best choice to become director! Rand needs to get off his high horse &amp; show respect for them!

More than anything it appears as a gateway site to the work of scholars that address their topic of interest.It is acceptable to quote reliable sources on Wikipedia. < - > Even if a webmaster or editor is reputable, that doesn't mean their website has been fact-checked.

For god's sake- a man and his daughter and a policeman are in hospital as a result of a chemical weapon attack on our soil. If this is your response to serious and complex debate about how best to respond its time to definitely take some time out from social media. https://t.co/xzzKCI6Rrp < - > @stellacreasy Whereas the tweet you've retweeted is certainly not constructive discourse, the response to Corbyn in the commons was hardly constructive either. France and Nato seem to largely agree with Corbyn, maybe others could explain in a constructive fashion why they disagree?
I hope Levine can explain what he was trying to say because to me Levine seemed to be saying that authorities on pseudoscience are pseudoscientific themselves.Regarding, ''Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science. < - > I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy/authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren't pseudoscience (a reliable source for describing what is and what isn't pseudoscience), then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP:PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific.
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules. < - > The characterization regarding the use of the term terrorism on Wikipedia (''not allowed'') is incorrect.
That having been said, I'd probably consider Safari if I wanted to print a web page and make it look nice. < - > If you want to print a webpage and make it look nice, it shouldn't matter what browser you're using (unless one has terrible layout issues for printed pages) as the proper better printed font rendering will be used in each case.
If we MUST name Ireland and Britain with a group name, why not name it something less controversial, like ''West European Isles''. < - > It's not the business of Wikipedia to prescribe ''correct'' usage; as a matter of fact the term ''British Isles'' is being used for Britain and Ireland.

I understand the #Patriots have bigger needs than WR. They also have $20 million in cap space and very few options left to spend it on. They're going to address the defense in the draft. They can easily afford a WR like Crabtree. < - > @ezlazar I respectfully disagree. They have NO need for another WR. Cooks, Edelman, Hogan, Britt, Dorsett, and I really want to see if Riley McCarron can play. A lot of buzz around him last summer/fall.
Actually we do need to mention the different POV's mentioned in the article. A good introduction summarizes the contents of the article. < - > No, there are too many views and the differences are complex. It is a long enough article. The intro does introduce the article, and it states what the main issues of difference are (what is private property, which markets are how free), anything more specific would get too overwrought.

Yes, walking out of the classroom is some sort of statement. A few hours long statement that does absolutely nothin… https://t.co/DyoZNsmarZ < - > @SouthernKeeks Perhaps, but I applaud kids taking a stand &amp; even if they can't vote yet, even if I disagree. Stand up for the 1st Amendment!
Reminder: Not only does the @NRA think teens should be able to buy semiautomatic rifles, but they’re trying to lower the age to buy a handgun to 18, too.  Eighteen to 20-year-olds commit gun homicides at a rate nearly 4 times higher than adults over 21. https://t.co/Je9pFRyvJL < - > @shannonrwatts @NRA @nra also believes teens have the right to buy and operate such deadly weapons for the purpose of killing aggressors and attacking a federal gov they disagree with, but should not be allowed to peacefully protest.
Why of all things? Why did they bring the muppet back? One of the biggest improvements of the prequals... and they brought the muppet back. He was 50% comic relief. < - > Luke is great tho. Everyone saying Luke is bad in TLJ I disagree.  He is like the deciple of a great sage having the duty of passing on his knowledge and growing frustrated by his inability. Giving up at his first mistake as a teacher and resigning himself to hermitude.  1/2
Yes. You fight guns with guns. Cowards who think they are attacking an unarmed population (school, concert, etc.) attack these places BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY UNARMED AND HELPLESS. It needs to change. Harden the target. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/QuoP85Lk8c < - > @LeahRBoss End of discussion because she disagrees wuth you. Her way or no way. I love how the left fights. If you don't agree with their opinion, you can't possibly be right and you should just stop talking.
All African Bantu cultures are almost identical &amp; languages are similar. We all greet strangers. We pay Lobola when we get married, u call any woman ur age sister, any man ur age brother, a man ur father's age father, a woman ur mother's age mother. Differences are superficial. < - > @TebogoDitshego I agree with you, I'll just disagree with the 'bantu' description. Bantu is a colonial term to dehumanize the meaning of the word abantu-batho-watu sub-humanize Africans.
I've read people twisting notcypher's words and telling her to choke just because she showed her opinion (which is not wrong but you only see your side, right?) y'all only need a word to start hating and that's pitiful, you can be so irrational, hypocritical, and individualistic < - > it's not because you don't agree with someone's opinion that that allows you to be impolite, rough and disrespectful, no one deserves to receive that much hatred for something so small but I guess y'all don't give a shit about other people's feelings
PatrioticHippie, the problem with your attempt to correct perceived errors with Wikipedia is that your claims are incredibly vague. < - > No legitimate suggestions of article improvement, just hand-wringing about ''liberals'' and SAT scores.I find it all over Wikipedia, but especially in the political arena, whether it's a politician or a political commentator or whatnot.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR Then shame on me gladly.  I encourage all Americans to participate in peaceful protest. And, respect others who disagree with them-unlike you.
For him to have made a comparison of how he is handling Dapchi abduction with how Chibok abduction was handled  by PDP GEJ government is a clear case of PMB not growing above party sentiments as a President! Sad, very sad. @NigeriainfoFM @tolulopeab @liborous < - > @simplysune14 @NigeriainfoFM @tolulopeab @liborous I disagree with you The first false imagination by you guys is that you think h4 doesn't get the gist of what's being discussed in the media The media &amp; some NGO's started d comparison immediately d Dapchi crisis happened, wc he got wind of and this is his way of replying
San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks, with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there, so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead. < - > ''special protections codified into law...so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead.'' There is no mention in the article of special protections.
I completely agree but can we add redbot x the campfire for nostalgia sake?  or not  you're absolutely right i hope… https://t.co/PFJdC6FsVc < - > @astrxnema No. I only accept Loturra as cannon. If you don't agree with me, you can fight me. Your opinion is invalid
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead. < - > Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas.
The firing of rockets seems to me to be a desperate measure to resist an ongoing occupation that has imposed a blockade with catastrophic consequences for the Palestinian people. < - > Two words - suicide bombers.
I’m sad:( I was supposed to give a speech at my schools walkout, but we ran out of time and I didn’t get to go🙃 #NationalWalkoutDay, < - > @PoliticalEmilia I am sorry you're sad and didn't get a chance to say your speech. Why don't you just post your speech ? We all would like to hear it, and I'm sure everyone will agree with me 😎
Ed Willes: You can't put a dollar value on hosting a World Cup #bcpoli #soccer  https://t.co/aFtQntdtE7 < - > @jasjohalbc So you disagree with your friends over at Global BC @DOUBLEJGLOBALBC  and @sbarnesglobal ?? You are nothing more thank a barking seal. Pathetic. #bcpoli
The Russell ref is nearly 30 years old, and given that the fairly uncontroversial sentence that it was used for already has two valid refs I see no reason to include it; similarly, the Montpetit ref was supporting uncontroversial information already well-cited, so I moved it to support other information that was less so. < - > There's no need to delete these references. And the Government of Canada is not a publisher; all federal government material is published by the Queen's Printer for Canada.
The article states that ''As of 2004, the vast majority of worldwide sex abuse cases have been in the United States'' - would you agree to that? < - > The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S. is 'investigational bias'.
I've removed some insensitive comments, the result of which were to offend some editors here and to distract the talk page from discussing the content of the article. < - > Your removals are unwarranted. I have violated no rules. It is not incumbent upon me to ensure that a group of Asperger's sufferers (and I have no doubt this page attracts far more editors with Asperger's than any other group) are not offended by statements of fact, and I have stated nothing but fact.
Currently, the lede states that ''The USSR joined the Allies''. < - > So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct.
You, on the other hand, just seem to use this talk page as a platform on which to display your ego as you bash about the head visiting genocide denialists. < - > I discount your mischaracterization of my contributions here.
◄رائیونڈ میں ہونے والے بم دھماکے کا جائے وقوعہ دیکھیں الیکشن میں صرف چند ماہ رہ گئے ہیں اسکے سیاسی مقاصد بھی ہوسکتے ہیں ◄پچھلی بارخودکش بمباری ہمارے اپنوں نے کی تھی آنیوالی ٹیموں کوپھٹیچراورریلوکٹا بول کر @gulbukhari https://t.co/hlEAZ64qS7 < - > @SocialDigitally @gulbukhari I wonder how can one disagree with such straight forward things. Why some people always remain in denial? Gul is right, but the two people on right side of the frame keep showing reaction.
"Dems, don't get too excited about Pennsylvania race — it's just a blue blip" https://t.co/vycgpbcDr4 https://t.co/Xo9rYTJeux < - > @thehill I disagree - Yes Saccone was mediocre. But Saccone was also the exact candidate that I see running in other places in the GOP.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Mutations, by themselves, will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones.
Shout out to the kids who are refusing to be part of the #NationalWalkoutDay.  Your classmates are too stupid to realize they are being used as pawns.  Instead of “protesting”, they should be spending their time in a history class learning WHY we have our 2nd amendment right. < - > @Education4Libs The blunt truth: The end goal of demoncat gun control/confiscation is to have unimpeded Access to rape your children with impunity- sorry if you disagree- look at the track record 😡😡😡😡

This happens up and down all the countries in the 6 Nations - it's called humour. Never serious, just gentle digs. https://t.co/cVTd0QNe0Q I know he is in a public position, but surely we all see this for what it is?? SURELY !!!! < - > @willcarling Sorry Will, have to disagree with you here. There’s no humour there. As a Welshman who’s lived in England for 15 years I’ve heard it all and know the difference between ‘humour’ and offensive comments. Expect better from an international head coach
Because that is not the common name. < - > @MacTire ''Britain and Ireland'' is common name though.
But others simply use ''non-Indo-European'', which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn't changed since primeval times; so I'd prefer to use ''non-Indo-European'' rather than ''pre-Indo-European''. < - > Dumu, I'm not sure how you figure we can't say with a fair amount of certainty it's pre-IE.
Is violence ever the answer? https://t.co/cXmE0rh5UN < - > @AtheistRepublic Not in civil society, except by the state.  It’s fun to watch SJWs equating people they hate like, Sargon, with Nazis. @steve_shives and @danarel and their fans who disagree should not only be allowed to speak, but we should platform them, debunk them and mock them ruthlessly.
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > No, it hasn't been agreed upon by all users yet.
Once again, all fictitious forces are ''coordinate dependent things'', so your comment is a complete non-sequitur. < - > No.
And there's nothing wrong with being a ''narrow-minded, ignorant bigot''. < - > There is EVERYTHING wrong with being a bigot.
This episode is with @Abraha3am, the co-founder of @Muslimish. Ibrahim is a firebrand ex-Muslim activist who is known for his fiery speeches and no-holds-barred criticisms of #Islam, the #Quran, and all religion in general. https://t.co/RGj5OIiL43 < - > @SecularJihadist @ArminNavabi @Abraha3am @Muslimish Armin, I agree 100% that words have meanings &amp; we should expect those meaning to b enforced. If u don't meet the most basic definition of a Muslim than don't call yourself one. The more self described Muslims the more powerful Islam becomes.  There is strength in numbers.
I'm very concerned whether this article should be at ''Black people'' at all. To my mind it seems a very patronising and unencyclopedic 1950s term, and classifies a diverse group solely by an inaccurate description of their skin colour. < - > I'm black and I don't find this offensive at all.
House of Lords TRIGGERED over Tommy Robinson Presence https://t.co/x4pRVE7fTq < - > @TRobinsonNewEra Extreme?? But not the returing jihadists or imams with anti-western/terror sympathies. Only Tommy and the people who speak on the truth of islam. Does the House of Lords have nothing better to discuss than "hate speech"?? Which is to say discussing thoughts they disagree with.

Ironic how school campuses want safe spaces so students' feelings don't get hurt....but no safety when it comes to protecting them physically. #SecureOurSchools #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @DeepSouthProud Well, and in many cases, no safety when it comes to exercising their rights to free speech if they disagree with the powers in charge of the schools!
🚫STOP‼️ 🚫By covering Trump’s hateful,insulting,bullying anti-women,racist,bigoted,threatening,divisional Speech it emboldens,supports FEAR,HATE AND VIOLENT acting out towards “others”‼️ 🚫His Speech wasn’t supporting a GOP candidate it was to spew his HATEFUL RHETORIC‼️ < - > @koslen_bambi Trump is a failure and must be stopped. Part of achieving this is learning to talk with people we disagree with. American Times is a documentary that offers some hope in these dark times.: https://t.co/hu8N1SXuXb ^EM
The template image seems to advance Europhilia and anti-Americanism in that the euro symbol is placed in front of the dollar despite the fact that the United states is a larger and more powerful economic force than the EU. < - > You could argue that either of those promotes one over the other. As such, I don't think it's worth arguing about; it's just a symbol, and not intended to have some deeper symbolism than representing economics using two of the most prominent currencies.
Abeg don’t come here to argue rubbish... https://t.co/ZGQ8TBa9zg < - > @TheMoondoos It's either you disagree with me or see my point and keep it moving. No need for insults ma
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts, which is not criticism at all. < - > What I actually said was that if criticisms are notable and reliably sourced, then they should be included, and that consensus without a valid objection, such as on the basis of sourcing or notability, should not be enough to prevent the subject's mention.
Of course religion is a social construct, but you don't need to make ridiculous claims about babies being atheists to make that argument. < - > Oh I wish. Its not even that simple. Shiver, because its not entirely a fad. The suffix of -ism can simply define a state or condition and not only simply a belief or position. I think this is why we can talk about non-theism and have an article on nontheism. Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
When are real Americans going to stand up to these repulsive pricks? https://t.co/DY6DR2unaM < - > @piersmorgan Don't agree with most of the things you say @piersmorgan but your spot on here. Sadly if the president won't stand up to them I don't see any change whatsoever.
Given that the version of the UK CoA used in Scotland is a CoA of the UK and not the CoA of Scotland, and that a single image exists which displays both that version used in Scotland and elsewhere, the image showing both versions should appear in the info-box as both are a Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. < - > Keep the single image, with a note as suggested, linking to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom article.
LaSalle St is sleepy on a Saturday morning, but I'm working!  Join me on @CNN with @smerconish at 9am ET. https://t.co/S9R53kvAkg < - > @CortesSteve @CNN @smerconish @CortesSteve, I disagree with pretty much everything you say on @CNN ... to the point I searched for you on here.

Given that disambiguation pages properly disambiguate terms and articles aren't about terms (that's what dictionaries do), it's probably never going to be a proper encyclopedia article.- ( < - > The whole ''dictionary'' canard has been debunked long ago. (This isn't about bark.) The subject of centrifugal force, including its variety of meanings, both as it has evolved through history, and in current usage, is itself a subject.
In addition, GBooks links are not available to everyone - they depend on a number of factors, including geographic location (as some countries have stricter copyright laws than others - Google limits viewing capabilities to comply with local rules) and how much you use Google Books (if you use it too much you'll run into a viewing limit, in which case these links could not work at all or could (in the case of page-specific links) lead to the wrong page). < - > The last argument, that some people won't benefit from the links, is unpersuasive.
My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > The text states ''the Great Seal of England be used as the Great Seal of the United Kingdom'' etc., so I think it would be best to keep that one in the infobox.
It's very good, but not even as good as the game it's directly copying or like a dozen other games from last year https://t.co/tTXNoBWunK < - > @Cosmis I disagree, it's a very good game, but I think Donkey Kong is the best game ever.
The (on-campus) vigils are student-lead, voluntary &amp; approved by the Springdale School District. https://t.co/nDddnYpxCn < - > @5NEWSAlex I would WANT my child to participate in the walkout. I disagree with detention, and am shocked to hear students were threatened with expulsion. Activism should not be punished! This is for something bigger than us!
The sociological article is quite clear in establishing a usage that is the same as the other sources I have posted above, namely ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'', feel free to offer sources that you feel support your claim that there is not a consensus established about this by quality sources. < - > I could provide counterexamples, like the Encyclopedia of Philosophy: On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. Some other counterexamples are cited in Wiktionary:Citations:atheist and Wiktionary:Citations:atheism, which chronicle each sense of those words being used for centuries.
As phenomena on Earth clearly do work (which requires energy), a part of the energy is not lost into space but rather does work on Earth. < - > On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths).
Guess who #HillaryClinton is now blaming for her EPIC loss? WOMEN! She somehow thinks women can’t think independently? And that women basically voted the way their husband voted! WHAT?! How insulting! https://t.co/imj4A0TrxS < - > @trish_regan You are really overreacting to Hillary Clinton's words. I know you disagree with her politically, but she has a huge following among women and you need to recognize that! She never said that she doesn't think women can think independently. You misinterpreted her statement.
Today, my school held a walkout for the gun violence that has been occurring in the U.S.  I do believe that gun violence is an issue that the government needs to fix.    Students should not have to go to school in fear of getting shot and losing their lives. < - > I don't care if you disagree with me, but innocent lives are being taken because of people who decide to misuse guns.   I believe bullying plays a large part in this as well. Some teachers don't listen when you are bullied then they wonder why kids bring guns.
I don't know what people expect.  We elected Trump to get the job done and he is running the country like a business.  If you aren't doing your job the way it needs to be done then you are fired.  Thats the way it should be. #Tillerson   #YoureFired   #SOTSwamp https://t.co/C70w3oJ212 < - > @SickOfTheSwamp @Tamara09932546 Totally agree! Just cause he replaced someone doesn't mean there is chaos! If he finds they disagree with his AGENDA he has a right to fire them. He wants his people behind him 100%
The original Dark Souls is still the standard for a cleverly-interconnected world, IMO. Everything feels organically baked in as one world, as opposed to numerous areas strung together and separated by obvious gates. < - > @mistermegative Yea, I can't really disagree, at least considering what style of game it is. A lack of interconnectivity is probably one of my extremely few complaints about Bloodborne.
Im both and i fucking hate how y’all do this shit. Mexicans hate salvis and salvis hate Mexicans. Both need to quit this shit. https://t.co/Aaz0Nlhfvn < - > @cindyysinn I really don’t hate anyone.

Childhood is a series of events you didn't realize were traumatizing until much later. < - > @SirEviscerate @abstex Disagree.
We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina. < - > The original wording was off base, as I believe are the comparisons to Katrina.
So the IMDB says Rihanna The Queen Of The R&B... < - > IMDB is not a reliable source.
However, your addition introduced some content that may need better verification or qualification; I see that the only source verifying criticism of Obama and/or BP—and it undoubtedly exists—is the Christian Science Monitor (who, I'll hazard a guess, supported exploratory off-shore drilling before this happened), and I don't really think they're a reliable source. < - > Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas.
Shifting gear for final talk @philipseargeant @carotagg Have a think now &amp; ready your response: Q1-  Have you ever been offended by what your friends write on Facebook, and what did you do about it?  #AltUniAir @oubucu #FB #FakeNews #USS #UCU < - > @AltOpenUni @philipseargeant @Carotagg @oubucu I’ve been a bit taken aback in a couple of cases - surprised sometimes who is a Brexit supporter for example.  I have friends I disagree with politically but we are both aware. Only unfollow was of my 2nd cousin who came out as a Farage and Trump supporter 😲🤢😫
I doubt the average American uses it either as most Americans cannot tell the difference between England and Britain. It is only common name in Britain, which means, on a World scale, it's not actually common name at all. < - > You seem so sure it's not a common name. Prove it.

-I agree that the full Nicene Creed should stay. < - > I think readers who are unfamiliar with the RCC or other Christian religions which use the Nicene Creed won't necessarily understand what it is saying.
The WP:RS are unanimous: HIV causes AIDS. < - > There are Reliable Sources the world over who dissent on this topic, therefore, it is NOT unanimous.
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > The majority of editors involved here had an other opinion.--
This is not a list of topics that are characterized as a pseudoscience in light of current, or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method. < - > First off, this is not properly a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by somebody at some point in time for all of history, but rather is properly presented as a list of topics that are characterized a pseudoscience in light of current, or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method.
i mean who wants to read about my life, it's boring... < - > I mean, I do really like the pictures because I'm more visually oriented, and I am happy that you'll be posting more photos, but I like to read about your life too.
I don't know why the Japanese bishop hired a man for some unknown job when he had been accused of reading pornography as a student. < - > It is Yakima, WA in the good old U.S.A.
''Canada's status as a Dominion within the British Empire ended with Parliament's independent declaration of war on Germany on September 9, 1939'' is a pretty audacious assertion that I've certainly never heard before, and I've done a fair amount of work on this encyclopaedia that relates to the evolution of Canada's independence. < - > It's true that Canada phased out it's use gradually, but the independent declaration of war is generally accepted as the Constitutional precedent that established Canada's functional independence to the British Monarch. That is confirmed by Heard's 1990 quotation of Scott above. It also explains WHY the Canadian government stopped referring to Canada as a Dominion; it was a deliberate and significant act by the Canadian government to assert its independence from the British Monarch. It was a way of consolidating Canada's first act of total independence in its foreign affairs. That's not me saying it; it's the constitutional scholars quoted above. Again, almost all constitutional scholars agree with Scott's opinion.
The Gaza population density is 4118/km2 which is ranked the 2nd densest urban area in the world. < - > My data seem to disagree with that - see, for example, here, page 77 - Gaza is ranked 36th, and that's counting the Gaza city area, not the entire strip, yielding a much higher density of 16,450/km2.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose, belatedly, per my many comments on this topic per WP:WEIGHT and this section of WP:FRINGE.
As long as we can all agree what’s offensive, I think we’ll be fine. < - > @ManMadeMoon I disagree fatty
Criticism of Corbyn this morning is not just "usual suspects" or right-wing papers.  The Guardian says that Corbyn’s "reluctance to share Mrs May’s basic analysis of the Salisbury incident made him look eager to exonerate a hostile power". < - > The Daily Mirror says he should be "concerned that so many Labour MPs disagree with his approach, accusing him of not being hard enough on Russia".
Women hate women more than they hate men!! < - > @MogulWoman @yeankhar I don't agree , women always have issues among one another but I have seen women stand up for one another several times .

This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
That's fine those future voters will not reelect you and outlive you too can't wait to see what the history textbooks our generation writes will have to say about people like you https://t.co/96wQvE1cNA  *cough cough its called the first amendment. < - > @davidhogg111 While I disagree with many of your arguments I will always support peaceful protest for your beliefs and people who try to punish those who do so are behaving in an Un-American way.
The pertinence of the quotation is that centrifugal force can injure you, and mathematical shuffling of terms from one side of an equation to the other hardly captures the reality. < - > No, that's completely wrong.
That was really obnoxious! < - > I thoroughly enjoyed it, less for the whinging and more for the astute observations of Hollywood culture.

As I said in the message to which you are responding, a frame is NOT a coordinate system, it is an equivalence class of mutually stationary coordinate systems. < - > No. You said: A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame.

The last section, titled ''Dangers of religions,'' makes sense in an article about atheism, but only if the atheism's dangers are also addressed. < - > ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ What ''dangers'' of atheism?

Open letter to Shaun Abrahams: Do not prosecute Jacob Zuma https://t.co/bhnXQ65Vxk https://t.co/r0ubZfxAJr < - > @TimesLIVE I don't agree. People are prosecuted daily for corruption and fraud. Why should he receive privileged status not to be prosecuted. 700 plus cases no way.
When men’s wages fall, families collapse. It happened in inner cities. Now it’s happening in middle America. For some reason, our policymakers ignore this fact. In fact they make it worse. We won't. We'll talk about the problem tonight, in part two of "Men in America." < - > @TuckerCarlson Like for real they're just parties just because someone is Republican doesn't mean they believe in Every policy that the government passes. just like all Dems don't agree with EVERYTHING that the Democratic party pushes we are all American and should unite
But when we are trying to present a picture of waterboarding as a general practice it does not make sense to have more than half of the article be examples from the last five years about the US military. < - > It's inevitable that most of this article is going to be about the recent use of waterboarding by the U.S.
We are "united in our condemnation of Russia's actions" - Scotland's first minister @NicolaSturgeon says she supports PM's initial actions over poisoning of former spy in Salisbury    https://t.co/VyS3tSGjuI https://t.co/giSOLzFdb7 < - > @BBCNews @NicolaSturgeon @NicolaSturgeon is doing the right thing in her position and supporting defence of the country whilst putting party politics aside for this important issue. I disagree with pretty much everything she says, but she deserves respect for her professionalism with this.

That’s your issue, not mine. I can agree that opposing fellow Americans is  not working for you (or Trump) You seem very angry. I wish you well. God bless. https://t.co/rAtH4dWwQm
And Zionist entity and Zionist regime do NOT have different meaning at all. < - > I found ''Zionist Regime'' and other descriptions instead.
What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture. < - > Strongly oppose.
Colin, you did not quite have the authority to make a wholesale deletion, even though in general I agree with the action. The course should have been for you to ask that I delete them or notify me of it before deleting them.-- < - > Actually, per WP:NOTAFORUM, it is common to remove off-topic rants, but if Dbrodreck can solve the issue via another method, I'm not opposed.
I was going to read this poem that I wrote at our school’s walkout today but was told that it was “too political.” What is happening in our country is so much more than politics; it’s about safety and making sure nothing like this ever happens again #NationalStudentWalkout https://t.co/uM3Cru4qLF < - > @jake_snell19 Try using real arguments rather than spewing ignorance while questioning the basic morals of people with whom you disagree. It makes you look like an idiot &amp; a person who's not mature enough to have a real discussion. Good for the school for not making everyone there dumber.

If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy (and it is not clear to me that it does), I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal, although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church, and much more encyclopedia-worthy, to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum. < - > Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy.
As a Labour MP I disagree with Theresa May – but not on Russia | Anna Turley https://t.co/30PEXXzv3Y < - > @annaturley You should disagree with her on Russia, because so far she's utterly failed to follow internationally recognised protocols and has instead used the incident as an opportunity to bluster and agitate.
It's time for some game theory: https://t.co/tpDhVBfl3r < - > @cowenconvos You made no mention of the pending collapse of the Iran nuke deal set to occur same month. Trump will likely back out (as an Israeli I disagree bc it’s working), and use it to signal to NK that he’s not going to make a ‘bad’ deal. This changes NK calculations.
Now name me ONE person in Turkey who acknowledges Armenian Genocide and has not been persecuted. < - > Plus in the cases that are related to AG the defendants are not charged of ''acknowledging'', but the prosecutors usually pick some parts from their statements, that sound offensive out of its context.

Oppose I haven't yet seen a convincing reason not to include Carlson's research on the page, and simply because it is included is absolutely not justification to reflect jumbled criticisms from fringe sources. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
I think this is notable and the opening statement that Obama is our first black president in the Obama Wiki article should make mention of this, because of its historical significance. < - > So no.

The credentialism being exhibited here is amusing, but irrelevant: a psychology professor pretending that the orientation of the Earth, sun, moon, planets and celestial sphere has any impact on human traits, interactions, or one-off events beyond that those that can be attributed to calendrical variation (yes, it is colder in the Northern Hemisphere in the month of December than it is in the month of June so your mother was more likely to be wearing more clothes when she gave birth to you in December than your friend's mother who gave birth in June) is not a reliable source for a very straightforward reason: the psychology professor is incorrect where the claims can be compared to evidence and otherwise is not even wrong. < - > No such claim is being made by any of the three psychology professors. Please show that you have read the thread over the past month, before commenting.
I'm the dreaded peer reviewer. < - > Karanacs, surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven't previously been involved in editing an article?
I hate trump supporters ahahahhahaha https://t.co/wFG9uCHwsj < - > @AmSwizzyBeatts Trump is a disaster and must be stopped. One way of doing this is learning to talk with people we disagree with.

One of the higher ups at the company responsible for digital media distribution under Johnny's committed suicide. I'll look for sources and information and translate them later on. < - > The company is in charge of Johnny's web as far as I know. I will look more into it. I've only seen Bunshun report on if so far and I don't exactly trust them or agree with their stance in many things so I want to find more sources before spreading the information.

Old news: desperate "influencers" buy followers and likes. New news: desperate musicians buy spots on playlists. https://t.co/3RNGM0vg7y < - > @kevin2kelly Gotta disagree with you on this one. As a musician using these services I can say I'm delighted, hopeful and optimistic about this new tier of promotion. 'Desperate musicians buy spots on playlists' is an unhelpful oversimplification.

I'll restore the previous martyrdom image and hide the other image for now - there's no room for it further down, but it's a good image and would be okay at the beginning if there were actually a paragraph or two of introductory text for the culture section.Richard, this looks good. < - > Bleh, then we don't need a picture in the Martyrdom section.
Weird coincidence that the only non-Fox shows that have invited me on haven't been live. < - > @KyleKashuv That's not really weird at all Kyle. It's how this has worked since forever. When interviewing someone they don't agree with, they reserve the power to edit out remarks that destroy their narrative. Agree to do it, with the caveat that you make your own recording as well.
Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.-- < - > Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa were independent back in 1939, nobody denies they were allies of Britain from the very beginning of the war.
So if the name of the article were to change to Britain and Ireland, you would support the change? Or at least not oppose it? < - > No - I was only correcting myself. Worldwide, ''British Isles'' (or equivalents) is the prevailing term.
For it to be a conspiracy there has to be a guiding force, a cabal behind the whole thing. < - > but it's coordinated efforts to protect child predators.
It's my understanding, however, that you do not agree that there are two usages, but in fact only this secondary usage I call the ''coordinate'' usage. < - > Your understanding is wrong, as I've explained over and over and over.

We now need to discuss how to change the answer to question 1 to make sure it is noted that Obama was factually wrong when he stated in his book that he went to a ''Muslim school''.-- < - > I don't know if it needs to be changed, the links provided(in the FAQ) go into detail with explanations about it.

It was the way he fired Tillerson that I disagree with, because it was ruthless, tacky, unprofessional, cowardly. Tillerson called #Trump a "F"en moron last year. Tillerson got that one right!
McCabe is scheduled to retire on Sunday. This smacks of a petty, cruel effort to deny him his pension after 21 years of service to his country. https://t.co/4omLShxFIf < - > @Susan_Hennessey This just shows Trump is in no way presidential. He's just a kindergarden bully.   It will only take time for him to snap and walk into that kindergarden with an AR-15, shooting all the kids that don't agree with him.  The guy is a total lunatic.
Utah students join nationwide walkout in protest of gun violence https://t.co/xcx31BuV77 https://t.co/mTDPXZdcGM < - > @fox13 Where’s your story about the responsible kids who stayed in class and who vehemently disagree with the premise and the form of the walkout? Where’s the balanced reporting? #nationalwalkoutday
To keep the momentum going on #nationalwalkoutday I've partnered with @cottonbureau to spread the message that #KidsArentKevlar and we need to reform gun laws. All proceeds will go to @Everytown. Please support! https://t.co/fZcuEWDWD4 < - > @Travon @goldengateblond @cottonbureau @Everytown Not that I disagree, but I feel obliged to mention Kevlar alone won't stop a typical AR-15 round (.223/5.56mm), except maybe ricochet fragments, etc.   But of course kids aren't steel, titanium, or ceramic armor, either.

in this case it obviously important and add understanding for reader who click link to see what ``Zionist regime`` refer to``. < - > I give up on anti-semitic link, not big deal.
No. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.

If you disappoint 2nd n 3rd categories, they may not vote against BJP but just sits at home. That is enough for a thrashing defeat.
Wikt:practical: ''Being likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation; able to be put to use.'' I cannot fathom how Astronomy fits that definition, or will fit that definition until humanity gains an advantage from it aside from the theoretical (theory being the antonym). < - > But, the finiteness of the speed of light is indeed ''likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation'', namely to the creation of theories about stellar and galactic evolution.
What points? < - > I suppose your disregard for 'walls of text' led you to overlook them.
By the way, the forked article about ''planar'' motion is, I believe, very mis-named, because there is no need for any restriction to planar motion. < - > The article centrifugal force (planar motion) does treat planar motion, and the math on that page is restricted to that case.
I'm tired of saying exactly that, the problem is with a handful of editors who refuse to accept that that is what is meant by a neutral point of view and continually misrepresent the policy as 'no point of view'. < - > I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia.
Sex out of wedlock is a sin. The Bible: “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.”  Evangelical Christians love the Bible and hate sin.  Evangelical also love Trump. Seems weird to me. < - > @Elkklr Donald Trump is a disaster and he must be stopped. One way of achieving that is learning to talk to those we disagree with. American Times is a documentary that offers some hope during these dark times.: https://t.co/vsxxZUWa1m ^EM
Over-the-air still generates the overwhelming majority of sports TV audience. Daytona 500 had just 51K viewers per minute on FSGO (streaming) and 9.3M on TV. https://t.co/0iWmXQHd6h < - > @paulsen_smw I don't disagree with you, but if you look at the amount of streaming compared to 5 years ago, it is growing and will continue to.
The @bankofengland @PhilipHammondUK and the banks have learnt NOTHING since the last financial crisis.   https://t.co/WYKL6X0iBK < - > @SOLZ_ZYN @bankofengland @PhilipHammondUK I disagree....they've learnt that they can do what they like and the general population will not protest.  They've learned they can personally profit from "help" schemes and money printing.  They have learnt plenty. It's the people who have not learned

‘The official appealed to celebs to not indulge in advertisements of tobacco in the name of pan masala, tea, ilaichi or other goods as these are prohibited under Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) 2003.’  We need similar ramifications re:skin whitening products. https://t.co/Tt8qXU0sDl < - > @marymood I disagree. Skin whitening products of legit ingredients don’t harm health, tobacco does however. Skin whitening is monetising human insecurity, no different than any advertising.
All looks correct. < - > No, if you look towards the bottom of the page (in the succession navigation box), where predecessors and successors for any awards, offices, etc one has held or received, you will clearly see that Carol Moseley Braun is his ''predecessor'' and Alexi Gianoulias as his ''successor''.
It's ''pray against it, search your soul for what you have done and how to change, and take steps to rectify the wrongs and stop doing evil in order to keep the Devil at bay.''  Catholic doctrine doesn't allow ''the Devil'' as a ''get out of responsibility free'' card. < - > It's possible when the chief exorcist says ''the Devil lodges in the Vatican'' he means that, literally, the Devil is possessing members of the Church.
In the past 11 seasons, Josh McGown has 10 wins and 38 losses.   He'll be on a roster next year making $10 million. That's white privilege.

Nothing at all.   https://t.co/6OqH7i3xql < - > @ShaunKing Don't disagree with the one sentence in your tweet re: Kaepernick. Side note: if you're going to choose to rip on someone, at least have the decency to get their name right.
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article.

The initial statement should read along the lines of 'Atheism is a belief in the non-existence of deities etc' - not a 'non-belief' as it states. < - > No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists.
The PM showed mettle and resolve in response to Russia’s reckless use of nerve agent on UK soil. Jeremy Corbyn showed a wholesale lack of moral clarity.

The people who are celebrating Stephen Hawking’s death by saying things like “Well, now he believes in god” or “He has entered eternal torment” are truly the worst kind of people. < - > @GirlNamedBoston @mrfisk12 I disagree. Many are just people who don't understand and have the best intentions.  When my deafblind/seizure disorder  son died people told me he was free now. It didn't  upset me. In their way there  were just expressing their understanding of the struggle my son had to endure

How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today. < - > That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion, contraception and euthanasia though, which I feel is important to point out if we're going to directly address those issues.
Under the heading ''Spanish Civil War'' and concerning the bombing of Guernica, it is proposed to replace : ''[...]with a propaganda figure of 1,654 people killed widely circulated in the west, leading to charges of ''terror bombing''.[28] In reality the attack was tactical operation against a city with militarily important communications close to the front-line, and modern estimates yield no more than 300 - 400 dead at the high-end.[28][29]'' With : ''[...] with a figure of 1,654 people killed widely circulated in the west, leading to charges of ''terror bombing''. < - > Yes, Beevor supports those casualty figures, and cites them to two Spanish-language books.
These tags will be there forever, because there is absolutely no possible method to reach agreement with you. < - > I can't speak for others who have tried to place the NPOV tag and had it summarily removed, but my intent in placing the tag was simply to indicate that the NPOV of the article is disputed (which is a simple statement of fact, because I for one dispute it), and readers should consult the Discussion page for details of the dispute.

Mayorkas first said he was unaware of discussions to use these kinds of tools on a categorical basis, then later clarified that officials had talked about expanding the use of those powers.''

Thus, Nielsen ''An agnostic, like an atheist, asserts either that he does not know that God exists--or, more typically, that he cannot know or have sound reasons for believing that God exists--but unlike the atheist he does not think that he is justified in saying that God does not exist or, stronger still, that God cannot exist.'' It seems rather tendentious to insist that Nielsen here means to be taken to be saying that atheists hold either that God does not exist or that God cannot exist. < - > How do you figure it is tendentious? It is exactly what he is stating in the starting paragraph, and repeats again later - the reason for pulling in agnosticism seems to be to better explain atheism.
Hi friends - agree or disagree?

Perhaps you could do us the courtesy of specifying where WP:CITE contradicts Template:Cite book, OR says anything about not having accessdates. < - > Besides the fact that it's not listed under ''Book'', you'll notice it says that access dates are used instead of publication dates for web-only sources that lack the latter - books clearly do have publication dates. You'll also notice that the page provides examples of GBooks-inclusive citation formats, none of which include access dates. In addition to WP:CITE, you can also look at the standards applied at FAC - since this article is an FA, it must meet those standards.

You get exactly those same 3 forces (centrifugal, euler, coriolis) in polar coordinates which is applied to a non inertial frame in addition to the 'centrifugal force' that appears relative to the coordinate axes.

There was no ambiguity post-1931. The Statute of Westminster was absolutely clear: No act of the British parliament would have effect in Canada unless the Canadian government gave its consent to such. < - > It remained unclear whether the Canadian Parliament could advise the King on matters of War (i.e. whether Canada could declare independently of Britain). That's not my opinion, but the consensus among Canadian historians: ''Even though each of the Dominions was asserting and practising the right to conduct independent (though co-operative) foreign policies by the late 1930s, one crucial Imperial tie remained to be severed. Right up until the outbreak of the Second World War, it was not certain that the Dominions could take any independent stance on the declaration of war or neutrality. In this one vital aspect the unity of the British Empire lingered on, and it was based for the most part on the doctrine of the indivisible Imperial Crown; it was felt that anything less than the unity of the Empire would mean that the King could be advised to declare war on himself with respect to another of his territories. It was not at all certain that Britain had lost its unique right to advise the King on matters of war and peace for the whole Empire.''[4] That's a very important ambiguity and why Canada's independent declaration of war in 1939 represents another step in the long process to independence.
Certainly Unomi has not posted any, including the Sociology journal article, which merely talks about what happens to people's attitudes as they get older, and not how best to define those attitudes. < - > The sociological article is quite clear in establishing a usage that is the same as the other sources I have posted above, namely ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'', feel free to offer sources that you feel support your claim that there is not a consensus established about this by quality sources.

What matters is what the consensus position on the what the word means, if that consensus definition and that which you argue is preferred by atheists is one and the same then there is no issue. < - > If ''the'' ''consensus definition'' does not include the actual position of those who it purports to describe, then it's a worthless false consensus.

Is Wikipedia even going to mention it, or at least that he went down to the Gulf to check on the spill's cleanup process? < - > However, your addition introduced some content that may need better verification or qualification; I see that the only source verifying criticism of Obama and/or BP—and it undoubtedly exists—is the Christian Science Monitor (who, I'll hazard a guess, supported exploratory off-shore drilling before this happened), and I don't really think they're a reliable source.

The snapshot of the arguments has been presented by the proposer of the RfC in a simplified and misleading way to the extent that the well was poisoned. This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different. The editors who have commented in opposition did so with appeals to policy, namely DUE, FRINGE, NPOV, etc, and nothing about the new wording that's been added would seem to change that because the content itself is what violates policy, not just how the introduction to the content in the RfC was worded.

For this application of the mathematical construct, the coordinates are given physical interpretations in terms of space and time. < - > Again, you completely miss the point. In dynamics the coordinate systems are four-dimensional, including a time dimension. (Otherwise, there could no such thing as a ''rotating coordinate system''.) Also, please do try to bear in mind that you aren't arguing with me, you're arguing with Grunbaum, Earman, Friedman, Stommel, Beer, Johnston, etc. etc., in other words, all the reputable sources that present the view of this subject that you are trying to suppress. Wikipedia policy is to accurately represent all notable views on the subject in a proportionate way. The current article strictly excludes all but one POV. This is not in accordance with Wikipedia policy, and I'm trying to correct it. I've provided plenty of references from the most reputable sources to show the existence of a very notable view (actually several notable views) of this subject, and I am working to incorporate these, in a proportionate way, into the article. It seems to me that you have a strong feeling of ''ownership'' over this article, and you absolutely refuse to allow any view other than your own personal point of view to be represented. In the long run, I don't think you will be able to maintain the level of personal ownership of this article.

Actually wouldn't calling it ''Standard English'' instead of ''British English'' not be a better and mroe neutral idea? < - > For some reason recent comments are not showing up for me except in edit or revision history mode...Anyway, I doubt our American, Canadian or Australian readers would agree to the use of ''Standard English'' as a more appropriate term for ''British English'', as they would surely regard their own variety of English as ''standard''.
Within that context, general curvilinear coordinates are the most comprehensive, and when the discussion is framed in those terms, the entire subject becomes unified, and one sees that what had seemed to be distinct concepts are really just different ways of looking at exactly the same thing. < - > I'd agree that ''just the same thing'' can be described in various coordinate systems. However, the fictitious forces and the classification of the various contributions as ''centrifugal'', ''Coriolis'', or ''Euler'' depends strongly upon the observer's state of motion (e.g. are they rotating? and about what axis, oriented how?) and not upon their selection of coordinates (Cartesian, arc-length, etc.) to describe what they see.

Their designation had nothing to do with elections status or democracy in the PA, and so should not change due to the elections.''you're going to justify dropping bombs on city centers and in the middle of civilian populations by saying they're ''military targets''???''

Listen, you can defend torture, or you can defend the Constitution. Not both. The 8th Amendment explicitly forbids… https://t.co/ePFXZXSTik < - > @Snowden I disagree with your premise. War is war and everything is on the table. The 8th Amendment does not pertain to foreign combatants.
Also, the recent audit found almost all of the diocese in compliance - there was one or two that did not meet some requirement so they failed - they were in fact doing most of the things required but not all. < - > And, a recent report that has audited some US dioceses has found non-compliance of their own prevention abuse guidelines.
I think the people who complain about "politics" in "kids programming" are actually angry that their kids are being informed and they don't get to put their slant on it first. < - > Because, let's face it, whenever that complaint is made, it's involving a compassionate take on a topic they disagree with: kids with parents in jail (Sesame Street), homosexuality, gun control, schoolkids not wanting to be shot, etc...
But this article should be perhaps changed to 'Armenian Genocide Theory' or 'Armenian Genocide Claims' in order to neutralize the article. < - > Sorry to say, but your weasel tactics to justify the mass slaughter of a million armenians are a bit far fetched.
I do hope there is no appetite to use newspapers' support for Tory glee at Corbyn's more careful assessment of the attempted assassination of the Skripals to have another go at unseating him. < - > @npotter32_nick I doubt it Nick. For the first time in my lifetime the membership has control of @UKLabour and rightly so. Even if I disagree with many of them. This has finally sunk in with the parliamentary party.
Today @realDonaldTrump is visiting California &amp; my district. Pleased he will see firsthand how CA grew to be the 6th largest economy in the world based, in part, on our diversity. CA also has a $6.1 billion budget surplus.   Trump can learn a lot from @JerryBrownGov.  #trumpinCA < - > @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @JerryBrownGov It's interesting how he thinks Jerry Brown has done such a terrible job in Cali. Oh, that's right, if you don't agree with his policies, you're a failure!

Of course, this should be done for all of those countries, but we have to start somewhere. < - > The FACT is, people have been trying to impose this made-up category on this article page for years, when in FACT, they should have been removing it from other country article pages, because it has no basis among reliable external sources.
I hope Levine can explain what he was trying to say because to me Levine seemed to be saying that authorities on pseudoscience are pseudoscientific themselves.Regarding, ''Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science. < - > I definitely wasn't calling any sources ''pseudoscientific''.
i was always terrified of needing someone, it was simpler to feign my strength along with all my other lies but the needing came, irreversible, irrefutable and it swept everything away, the deceptions and my strength. < - > you are not as dependant as you think you are.
It means that ''God exists'' makes no meaningful claim & can be neither true nor false. It also means that ''God does not exist'' makes no meaningful claim & can be neither true nor false. It means that ''I am justified in saying, 'God does not exist''' makes no meaningful claim & can be neither true nor false -- except for the anthropomorphic God. It means that ''no adequate nonanthropomorphic extralinguistic referent for the word 'God'' has been obtained'' does make a meaningful claim and CAN be either true or false. < - > Close - but ''God exists'' is not what is being sought a referent for, God is, and reference failure isn't ''can be neither true or false'', that is the property that it has for not referring to anything.
Sorry JimWae, but it is difficult to express just how extraordinary a claim that is without seeming insulting. < - > I am quoting parameters given in the article itself. Nobody has agreed that the response you got from someone at EB resolves anything in your favour--
I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church. < - > Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.

I would favour wording along the lines of : Broadly speaking atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities (gods), most simply expressed as the position that there are no deities, or the explicit rejection of belief in deities. < - > There are some problems with the term 'rejection', to reject a claim you have to first be presented with it and be able to consider it, for example babies are atheists which would not meet this criteria, a baby doesn't reject belief but simply lacks belief. 'Absence of belief' is a better general term to use.

Listen, you can defend torture, or you can defend the Constitution. Not both. The 8th Amendment explicitly forbids torture with all forms of cruel and unusual punishment. To defend torture is to attack the Constitution. < - > @Snowden I don't agree. If someone kidnaps a child, you only have a very limited time to recover them. If you capture one of the kidnappers, you need to do whatever you can to recover the child. Afterwards, give them the death penalty.
The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source. < - > The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context.
Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools.

I think that B qualifies as a ''Practical effect'' of A, or even better as a ''Practical consequence'', or, if you like, as a ''Useful consequence'', or as a ''Useful effect'', or as a ''Useful application''. < - > I guess this is what happens when you come to a page frequented by science geeks (not an insult: I'm one too). The ability to measure a distant star is considered ''practical'' on the same level as everyday usage of a computer or a GPS.

I restored the source and changed the wording to (hopefully) better reflect what it is actually saying. < - > I completely agree with your point that the citation does not point to a ''review'' of Canada's ''economic weight in space science...'' BUT IMO the present sentence can readily be construed as such. In brief, the sentence misinforms by giving a tabular ratio undue weight. The cited source does not report a ratio that pertains directly to ''academic institutions'' (sic, this is what WP presently is saying) (this is not the Times Higher Education World University Rankings) but purports to be a tabular ranking of an 'impact factor' (that is being floated by the source as a conceptual surrogate for something like ''average publication quality'') of academic papers in space science ''from'' (sic, the source) Canada. I readily concede that using the term ''institution'' is sort of logical, since it is quite likely (but not confirmed for us) that this was the descriptor in the database, but from a WP point of view, ''institution'' isn't what the source says, and while we are probably right, we don't know (at least not from this source as written). The source uses a vague term, ''from'' and that's what we can cite (if the source in all it's considered aspects is adjudicated as providing material of encyclopedic character, and not of undue weight.) IMO we could arrive at... '' In 2009, Thomson Reuters collated data in a proprietary index of academic papers from 1999 to 2009; those from Canada ranked third in impact... ...'' The cited source does not itself purport to look at ''research'' papers only (sic, this is what WP presently is saying, and by saying it, WP implies that was all that was indexed, and that's not what the source says), but at a composite of ''...only journal articles (original research reports and review articles) indexed by Thomson Reuters...'' So correcting that point, and simplifying a little (by losing excessive words), and using the source itself, we get something like, '' In 2009, Thomson Reuters, collating data from 1999 to 2009, ranked Canada as having the third highest national average of citations per academic space science paper...'' or simpler, we have ''Canada has the third highest number of citations per academic space science paper...'''' ... That's close to what you have, BUT... IMO, after thinking carefully, the two principal problems with the citation and the wikipedia sentence it supports are 1. an inappropriate source (''unreliable'' in wiki-speak) that is 2. given undue weight.

Surely you are aware that this is just tertile being expressed in more user-friendly way (colours and words 'high','medium','low'). Are you saying that we cannot even divide by three because it is considered original research and not simple logical deduction? < - > Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Why not divide by two, or four, or five, or six, or eight?

There's lots of examples of indie startups going in a market that hardly existed. There was no site like @nomadlist when I made it!
The sociological article is quite clear in establishing a usage that is the same as the other sources I have posted above, namely ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'', feel free to offer sources that you feel support your claim that there is not a consensus established about this by quality sources. < - > There are lots of counterexamples, and the text of the current article cites some of them. This has been repeatedly discussed over the years, we surely don't need a year zero approach. There is indeed a usage that interprets atheism as an index of certainty or dogmatism, an interpretation that is challenged by the work of many atheists who do not claim certainty. The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed.
Harald: Sorry for the confusion caused here. < - > I don't think the above comment address the point that Harald raised.
If ''the'' ''consensus definition'' does not include the actual position of those who it purports to describe, then it's a worthless false consensus. < - > It doesn't purport to describe people who call themselves atheists, it describes people who are atheists. Your argument is like saying that if a group of ~100 IQ people go around calling themselves geniuses that we should rush to embrace a definition of genius == 100 IQ.

Bernard Lewis is considered a ahistorical quack for a reason (see his biography) though even if he was considered mainstream or reliable, his opinion alone does not negate all the other historians who make up the majority POV currently represented. < - > Third, Bernard Lewis is certainly not considered a quack...

The current sentence says ''The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth, and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy'' - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space. < - > As phenomena on Earth clearly do work (which requires energy), a part of the energy is not lost into space but rather does work on Earth.

I disagree that ''Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY.'' While no one, except mostly reality show stars, become famous/notable for their personal lives, I do not believe that it's trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia. < - > I hold the position that personal lives are trivial within the scope of an individuals career, purely for the reason their personal life is obviously not their life's work.

I agree that there is diversity of opinion demonstrated in RS, but we should absolutely give primacy to the consensus position, and such a position does indeed exist as is made clear by EB and the majority of dictionaries and encyclopaedias. < - > ''Majority'' of dictionaries and encyclopedias is also not in fact demonstrated by the sources provided.
One of the reforms of the Council of Trent was regarding education for priests so we should have something - I think - in the article that establishes the Catholic Church requirements - even if it is to the bishops discretion up to a point which I think it is. < - > I don't know that it is necessary to go into this kind of detail here.

All reputable sources on dynamics recognize that time is one of the coordinates of the coordinate system. Are we really down to the level of arguing about whether time is a coordinate? An endless number of reputable references can be supplied to substantiate the fact that time is a coordinate in the science of dynamics, and that inertial coordinate systems include a time coordinate. The comments of Brews ohare are simply incorrect. Quoting from a book describing purely spatial coordinates does not contradict the fact that dynamics is carried out in coordinate systems that include a time coordinate. Perhaps we should ask for this point to be reviewed by a wider audience of scientifically literate editors, to see what they thing? < - > I would add that the mathematical idea of coordinate system is not restricted in any way to three dimensions nor to the interpretation of what the coordinates may mean in any particular application.
We need to be able to talk about capitalism without assuming it can only exist with ''free markets''. Take Braudel, who analyzed the history of capitalism without restricting himself to only studying where markets were ''free'', which would basically eliminate the entire discipline. < - > There is no such things as a capitalist system without free markets. A free market is one where the government is not dictating how much is produced and the price to charge.

If we're going to name categories, those names and categories must be based on external sources that meet our verifiability standards. We're not allowed to create category divisions ourselves, understand? < - > However, I do not see why 'highest third', 'lowest quarter' etc. would not be accepted as the verifiability policy states that 'drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research'.
there was no zionist entity prior to the zionist regime and if the regime in israel will cease to be zionist then israel will cease to be a zionist entity. < - > I agree that there can be no Zionist entity without a Zionist regime but a Zionist regime can still exist quite happily if Israel ceases to be a Zionist entity.

The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source. I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact. < - > The original sources, one of which was Kamen, actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence, (technically, released to the civil authority,) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out.

Oppose: Any mention of the criticisms mentioned as none of the criticisms have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and all of the ''journals'' in which they were published are clearly fringe, they should not be used at all to challenge a real scientific study. WP:PARITY explicitly states that fringe journals are not to be considered reliable sources, and that only reliable sources are to be used. The criticisms are furthermore not noteworthy of inclusion in the article because they have not been discussed in reliable sources, and are not in any way part of genuine scientific discourse. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.

This is a complete set to begin taking your rights and all these poor kids are and many parents are playing into it like good little sheep! #walkout #parenting #kids #InOurLifetime https://t.co/iiax1ceqtS < - > @cheechablunt I disagree. This isn’t about whether or not to ban guns. This is about  research so that we can end gun violence in our schools, our movie theaters, our churches, and all the other places we should be able to safely gather. For children &amp; grandchildren sake how can you say no?
Christine Talbot is such a milf < - > @ShannooonLP I can't disagree
I think this is notable and the opening statement that Obama is our first black president in the Obama Wiki article should make mention of this, because of its historical significance. < - > I think it would be WP:UNDUE to mention it on this article or go against the weight of reliable sources that say otherwise.

Let us be real...  To these ignorant children, these walkouts are just social events that get them out of school.  These are not profound political statements by deep-thinking young people.  The kids are being used as pawns.  #NationalWalkoutDay #walkout #WednesdayWisdom < - > @TheMarkPantano Gonna disagree with you. I have a junior and she organized her schools walkout. She worked with the principal. She and her peers are ready to take part in the political process. They are learning the issue and learning civics. Your lack of faith in them is misplaced.
No, it isn't clear and it isn't unambiguous. A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and the challenge to Wolf is to explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. Remember, the physics doesn't change for a choice of coordinate systems, nor does it change for a choice of a set of coordinate systems (i.e., a frame). Fictitious forces are fictitious. So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other? < - > You confuse the mathematical term ''coordinate system'' with the physical application of this mathematical construction in which a coordinate system is applied to describe physical events in a frame of reference. For this application of the mathematical construct, the coordinates are given physical interpretations in terms of space and time. For this application, a Cartesian coordinate system is not essential of course, and many other types of coordinate system are employed depending on how they simplify the problem. For example, an arc-length coordinate system might be used, or a polar coordinate system. I'm sure you know this - you're simply playing games here.
Another game where Al Montoya gives up at least four goals. Pretty convinced he’s not an NHL option moving forward. #Oilers < - > @Alex_Thomas14 Your negative opinion of a backup is sad.  He played well tonight so I disagree with your opinion
Just to remind that in archive 8 part 14 and 15 we discussed already the word ''terrorism'' and it was clear that the majority support it. < - > It's ''terrorism.'' —
Our reviews of the literature over the years have demonstrated time and time again that atheism has no single simple definition. Your own posts of the usual texts (and how familiar they all are to some of us old hands by now) demonstrate this once again. There is no consensus in the literature (sociological or philosophical). < - > Relevant and interesting, yes - impacting how we present the consensus definition of atheism, no. Consensus doesn't mean that everyone has to agree, it simply means that the majority of quality sources do. Let me clear up what I meant above, I certainly don't mean that we should exclude RS material just because it was written by atheists, not at all - what I meant to address was the notion that just because someone calls themselves atheist that they somehow have the ability to redefine what it means.
I personally found Tim's explanations to you to be quite clear and correct. < - > It's not enough to be clear and correct. We agree it's a clear and correct meaning. But there's only one meaning allowed per article, and that's not the dominant one.
#LarryKudlow is "a recovering alcoholic who once had a $100k/month cocaine habit." Regarding his finances, "I needed long-term care, and I didn’t have any money. I’d spent it on my addiction. I was unemployable." Now he's #ChiefEconomicAdvisor for the U.S. https://t.co/gsz0b9J2sJ < - > @BanditRandom The beauty of Life is You can Begin Again anytime. Larry Kudlow has redeemed himself -- clean/sober and a bright commentator respected by the business world. Disagree with his policies/politics, but don't denegrate him for Recovering -- leave low-brow to Mr. Trump &amp; his gang.🍸

Truth be told the statement “You don’t look Nigerian” isn’t a compliment. It implies that Nigerians traditionally look below par/unattractive and this occasion is somehow an anomaly. Eurocentric beauty standards are partially to blame. < - > @POTFW_ I disagree . I’ve been told I don’t look Nigerian a number of times and that I look more East African but as I’m from a small lesser known tribe me looking different expected. You cannot assume that it’s because of attractiveness when there’s so many other reasons.
It's not the business of Wikipedia to prescribe ''correct'' usage; as a matter of fact the term ''British Isles'' is being used for Britain and Ireland. < - > @Mike, what makes you think that the readers of the article will read that far?

In between directing tons of Goldbergs episodes, @jaychandrasekha made a sequel to one of the best movies ever. Yes, I first hired Jay 'cause he was Thorny. But I told him so. He was very gracious and continues to answer all my @brokenlizard fanboy questions. Can't wait for this! https://t.co/fwLcIXa11i < - > @adamfgoldberg @jaychandrasekha @brokenlizard I disagree....clearly "Club Dread" was the best Broken Lizard movie.....(Kidding No One thinks that)  I think "Beerfest," may be a bit better than Super Troopers though.
It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly. < - > Well, the news media thinks it has something to do with him.
Capitalist mode of production may describe it from a marxist perspective, and may therefore be useful in marxist contexts, but that description is consequently either misleading or inaccurate when applied to the real world and to evidence-based economics. < - > The thing is only even fully understood as such (i.e. als ''das Kapital'') due to Marx.
Mahrez &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez.  United definitely missed a trick with that one. < - > @MixahFanimo @Munanizzy I disagree
Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability. < - > But to say that Personal life sections (which by the way, do not have to be titled Personal life, as noted with the Angelina Jolie article) should not or should rarely be included in Wikipedia is something that I do not agree with.

But there's only one meaning allowed per article, and that's not the dominant one. It would just simply be undue weight to include it here: WP:UNDUE. < - > No, what was clearly and correctly explained is that this is all just different ways of looking at the very same thing.
I'm using it in the classic sense. ''Regulation'' is the setting of production and pricing. Supply and demand is regulation. Quantities produces and prices set can be regulated by supply and demand or by the government. When they're regulated by the market, it's a free market. When they're regulated by the government, theyre called ''regulated markets.'' It has nothing to do with safety regulations and what not. < - > There are enough definitions by political economists and historians to make this a POV issue.
Appointing an actual pliers and tongs torturer to head up the CIA makes the U.S. look like Uganda under Idi Amin. < - > @JulianAssange #disagree with this assessment.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > I'm not so keen on: Suggested re-wording: Modern challenges faced by the church include the rise of secularism, and controversy over its prohibition of abortion, contraception and euthanasia.
As long as you're rewriting what monuments were built for, perhaps you'd like to revive the one about Latvia's freedom monument being built to thank Stalin for liberating the Baltic states. < - > This is Transnistria not Latvia.
Again, you seem to have already decided for yourself what you think atheism is. < - > ''you seem to have already decided for yourself what you think atheism is'' - I would say that my understanding of atheism seems wholly supported by the majority of sources presented, I would have to ask why it is that your understanding is different.
Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous, I'm still excited. < - > Next week's is probably going to be a disaster.
Boozy literally trying to stan for RC Fox and expecting people to feel sorry for kicking his fucking child molester ass out of the fandom. Give me a fucking break. RC Fox was out on bail.  I don't give a flying fuck about what he did to himself. < - > @VenusAsABun Can you say you truly knew him? What about his family? Friends? Etc. They mourn and yet here you are saying more or less good riddance....  EVEN if we don't agree on everything OR if someone did something illegal why wish death upon them?...You are NO better than those people you
what is so hard to understand about ''Believers think that, though God is a mystery, such a referent has been secured, though what it is remains a mystery. Atheists, by contrast, believe that it has not been, and indeed some of them believe that it cannot be, secured.'' == ''Believers think that there is something that is God, Atheists believe there is no such thing as God, and some believe there cannot be something that is God'' - This is like trying to explain evolution to ID'ers, seriously. < - > I'm not sure, but with your stated equivalence above concerning referents, you seem to end up equating A:''P does not believe x'' (because no referent was secured) with B:''P believes not x'' which is not true in general because although B implies A, A does not always imply B. It is incorrect then to conclude that all atheists under Nielson and Edwards' similar definitions are strong atheists, who nearly always assert ''God does not exist''.
Well screw me amiright < - > @TomoyaAverett Disagree ☝️

The problem for Labour isn't that Corbyn wants evidence of Russian involvement. It's a request another leader might fairly make. It's that Corbyn's positioning makes us doubt whether evidence is what he really wants. Not sure how Labour solves that problem. < - > @JolyonMaugham Jo. I think this is much about your positioning as anyone else’s. Your views on JC are your own and as your right you interpret through the lens of your own bias. For the record, do you agree or disagree with *what* was said?
Waterboarding is torture, the use of torture here is a descriptive term - it explains what it is, and vital for an inclusive description of what waterboarding is. < - > By showing who says waterboarding is torture, and who says it isn't, we can educate the savvy reader.

Schools should teach the value abstinence and celibacy, says Church of England. We asked sex experts what they think https://t.co/xw9eWvv2jp < - > @indy100 It seems that the sex experts also have an agenda to disagree with the value of abstinence &amp; celibacy. If you ever need to read something more steamier than 50 Shades read the Songs of Songs (hint it’s in the Bible)

The difference between Pep and Mourinho is the former learnt from his mistakes last season,binned all the average players,replaced them with good ones while the latter still thinks Fellaini,Young,etc are good enough for utd. < - > @ScholesyLad While I don't disagree with this tweet,a few things to consider. Young isn't your first choice lb. Had Shaw not been injury prone,he would have started. Fellaini is needed for physical presence(reason you won EL). Had you sold both of them last summer,you would have abused Mou.

Let’s be clear: Putin is a thug. These sanctions are entirely necessary. The Obama Administration did nothing, giving Russia time to revert to their Cold War tactics. I applaud the Trump Administration for this strong stance to check these interferences here &amp; now. https://t.co/ryghvxURd8 < - > @RepMcSally Agreed. Putin is a thug.  Partial: Obama Admin did not do enough to thwart Russia's aggression.  Disagree re: Trump's strong stance. Remember that Sanctions bill you voted for that Trump largely thumbed his nose at? Where was your voice then? Can't speak without Trump's approval?
I think that the article should have only a few sentences on the sex scandals - that is very recent, whereas the Church's efforts to set up missions have been quite longstanding (think of the Jesuits). < - > I understand.

A dog is not a living thing just like me. Dogs are creatures, and they're fun and cute and nice. They are also infinitely less valuable than humans. https://t.co/a2C4fq5l10 < - > @michaeljknowles I disagree with your view on this. The thing that concerns me is this - why didn’t the dogs owner exit the plane. If they told me to stick my dog in the overhead, I would have respectfully said no, and then if nothing came from that I would have exited the plane.
“Criminals will just get guns anyway so what’s the point of changing the laws hurrdurr”  Oh ok. Why have speed limits? People will just speed anyway. Why make drunk driving illegal? People will do it anyway? Why have any laws at all? People will just disobey them anyway.  Idiots. < - > @jDantastic @Thundershot75 I disagree with your comparison but I understand your argument since you can’t know what someone will do with the gun and the type of guns sold should be limited. But your comparison was with laws being in place and not changing them. The debate isn’t over having the laws at all.

I think the point the author of that passage was trying to make is that Theravada is closer to the original Indian Buddhism than any other currently-practiced form of Buddhism is. < - > Theravada is in no sense ''closer to the original Indian Buddhism.''

Secondly, I am reading a couple of recent history books on early Buddhism, and neither of them support your other statement that this is a ''well-established point of consensus among Western scholars.''

Weren't the Mahayana texts created by the Mahāsāṃghika, which is THE oldest vinaya of Buddhism and the ''default'' vinaya of Buddhism, while Theravada is some side branch of some people who split off from the Mahāsāṃghika. < - > ''oldest branch'' is a very unclear phrase in this context. When talking about human genetic or linguistic history, ''oldest branch'' would refer to the group that split off earliest from the mainstream population; for example, we can talk about the Anatolian languages are the oldest branch of Indo-European because they have both innovations and archaic features that are not shared by any other attested Indo-European languages. However, that's different than what most people are likely to think it would mean: actually, all branches of Indo-European or of Buddhism are equally old, because they all go back to the same source (otherwise, it would be a mistake to think of them as branches).

Atheism is an accepted form of belief in Hinduism, but is considered by some schools to be difficult to follow spiritually.[16] Your earlier version did not communicate the i talked about in the first reply. < - > That last sentence is getting into specifics & I have doubts that it even belongs in the lede anymore. Why mention Hinduism twice? Also, the text somewhat misleadingly suggests all schools of Hinduism are being represented. Also, it is disputed that atheism IS a ''form of belief''.
The text in question, which was edit warred into the article by astrologers who are coordinating offsite, violates numerous content policies that others have mentioned. < - > I have not edit-warred on this, but have – for what I believe to be good reason – supported the inclusion of the comment or something similar.
The point is that when you make a pipe, you don't call the link ''an oil rig'' and then link to a specific named rig. < - > Again, you're incorrect about how you're characterizing my edits, even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of (or a lack of focus on) the issue.
When you don't have the decency to resist exploiting a geezer's death to push your own agenda... https://t.co/ceLXcqZzSP < - > @MrAlfredGarnett @Wycombemariner Reminding the world of issues about which Hawking was passionate.  A valid comment unless you disagree with what Hawking believed on these issues.
I imagine that what has happened is that in the POV push and pull that plagues articles like this, the information has been shredded by people, much like yourself, who place advocacy before policy and damage content. < - > I am not the one who put in any garbage about occupying regime.
We need sources that explain how prevalent these views are and whether TP-supported politicians would act on this. < - > the tp is very clear about its desire to reduce spending across the board.
The point is that when you make a pipe, you don't call the link ''an oil rig'' and then link to a specific named rig. < - > The ''an oil rig'' wording was not created by my edit, it was created by yours.
Rihanna is in the spotlight, everything seen should be documented. < - > One other thing: In regards to your comment ''Rihanna is in the spotlight, everything seen should be documented.'' According to our own policies, no it shouldn't.
This makes zero sense. https://t.co/am9Vj7hP4V < - > @WalshFreedom Out: "Our hero is surrounded by deep state globalist advisors who don't agree with his vision for America."  In: "Appointing people who disagree with you is brilliant."

if it's night then shouldn't there be light coming from the inside of the buildings? < - > And I disagree with Sean that you need light coming from the windows, because if it is that late most lights would be turned off, and places like the bar would have really dingy lighting anyway.
No, you simply cannot delete them, as per the direct instruction of WP:LEAD. < - > The other passage from WP:LEAD that applies here: ''Well-publicized recent events affecting an article subject, whether controversial or not, should be kept in historical perspective.
We should not encourage kids to walkout of class.  As a parent, I have encouraged my children to stay in class, help others and learn both sides of every issue. @ < - > @AntonioSabatoJr I agree.I think we need 2 lead by example again &amp; learn 2 respect each other, our differences &amp; show our children to do the same. Education is important &amp; not just on a school level but also on a personal level; to not discriminate against those we don't know or understand.
Some critics are calling this oil spill ''Obama's Katrina''. < - > If you actually read that article, you will find the ''critics'' are non-notable residents of the nowhere-near-the-spill NYC area.
Facebook Bans Trump-Retweeted 'Britain First' After Leaders Jailed For "Hate Crimes" https://t.co/Iut1UNIrCc < - > @zerohedge Would be nice to see what the "hate speech" was.   Nowadays, radical leftists call anything they disagree with "hate speech," including the words "he" and "she"
I think that the new MacBook pro is a very good laptop. It is so powerful! < - > Lol what? It is the most awful laptop ever! It cant even perform light tasks.
Happy 85th birthday, Ruth Bader Ginsberg. May I live to see a Supreme Court made up of nine women... https://t.co/d7A9EYBPQK < - > @shannonrwatts Respectfully disagree. The Supreme Court should reflect the diversity of the country - in thought, race and gender.
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy (and it is not clear to me that it does), I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal, although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church, and much more encyclopedia-worthy, to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum. < - > Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy.
All these suspected white supremacists are getting upset because people are not falling for their “dangerous racial… https://t.co/7jAHGcPGAL < - > @tariqnasheed So Ben Shapiro the Jew, is white supremacist? You can't just label everyone you disagree with a racist
NAACP 1st VP Joe Mallory: "The city manager was backing up the chief. The chief recommended that this individual who … cut him off at the knees needs to go. The manager was backing up his department head." < - > @ChrisCinciBiz I don’t disagree with that but I can’t be the only one who thinks he should have consulted with Council before firing a longtime member of the force without cause and costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.
This is  an example of why it's ridiculous when ppl talk about him "going w his gut" on issues, or his "game plan".… https://t.co/cBiGXMJhdm < - > @AndyRichter disagree, @NASA_Langley @DeptofDefense taught him their' maths'
The article states that ''As of 2004, the vast majority of worldwide sex abuse cases have been in the United States'' - would you agree to that? < - > The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S.
https://t.co/PDtOcEKP0R < - > @seanhannity Paul I disagree with you on this and wish you would quit feeding the Lib narrative. Both nominees Mike Pompeo &amp; Gina Haspel are great choices.
I believe the article should be changed to another name. < - > No, Wikipedia does not pander to fringe views, those are shipped off to Denial of the Armenian Genocide.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > I was OK with the sentence, I took it to mean issues that have just been brought up in the Modern era as opposed to issues like heresy in the Roman empire age.
This is not an issue of undue weight, but if anything of systeic bias (and is this case, of systemic bias in the sources). < - > It's undue weight because in historical perspective this is just one example.
Saying B is a practical effect of A, when B and A are both abstract sciences, seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur. < - > But nor A, nor B are abstract sciences here.
Saying B is a practical effect of A, when B and A are both abstract sciences, seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur. < - > But nor A, nor B are abstract sciences here.
The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S. is 'investigational bias'. < - > Wikipedia cannot compensate for the inequities of justice systems the world over. Too bad.
Regarding the deletion - I'd personally leave it there. < - > I have no prob with the paragraph itself, just not where it was.
Wouldn’t this country be a much better place if people stopped worrying about what everyone else was doing and just worried about themselves? < - > @NancyKel63104 disagree - we have to be concerned about others or else we just act completely selfishly in our own best interests, not regarding how our actions may be to the detriment of others.
Unclear is the pronunciation of s, x, z. < - > If there's no problem with the affricates, then there's no problem with the fricatives, since they have the same place of articulation.
I dont think so.The West isnt islamophobic really.The right wing of the respective country is islamophobic, and these right wing groups are all close to Russia(except for Poland and Hungary ones) https://t.co/7jdsrE4jem < - > @ramenplayswith1 well, I disagree with that. There is intense and rising Islamophobia on both the left and the right. And western states (stupidly) see only the problem of jihadism in the Middle East. Sure it's a huge problem, but still a symptom rather than a cause. But I should do some work...

Kindly answer the argument that precisely the same charge, deliberate proximity to civilians during warfare, was made against Hezbollah by Israel and was rejected; how does that NOT very importantly relate to the deliberate proximity to civilians during warfare charge against Hamas? < - > I've already addressed that argument, several times: Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was ''rejected'' in the Hezbollah case (it was not), it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance (different time, different place, different organization) is also the case in this instance.
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state (it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government) so clearly they can not be interchangable. < - > My personal opinion is that at this time in history, there is no difference between the use of regime and entity when concerning zionism.
Opinion | Who's next after Rex? Under Trump, the White House is in total meltdown https://t.co/vCJbqIhxwT  via… https://t.co/z8Dd6Q4lNl < - > @MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK I disagree. You can't melt down fecal matter. It's already squishy.
But the level of detail in a lot of the article can be reduced--the quotes are too extensive, we don't need to say much about KSM/Abu Zubaida other than that the U.S. < - > Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding.
Some critics are calling this oil spill ''Obama's Katrina''. < - > The consensus in the news is that it isn't Obama's Katrina yet.
Why add many extra steps for people who want to check sources?-- < - > It's not an awful lot of extra steps to click on the ISBN and then click on ''Find this book on Amazon'' (or Google, or whatever).
We should combat all bias, not just give up and accept it.Am I to believe these subjects and points have not been summarized already? < - > I understand your frustration but there's nothing that can be done about it.

Note the image was only used thumbnail size in the article so if you were so offended why did you click so to see the larger version? < - > I don't think it's a valid point that it's small - would it be okay to have a thumbnail of a detailed photograph of two people enthusiastically copulating on the sexual intercourse article if you couldn't see their genitalia in the thumbnail?
Seriously, why is @bbcquestiontime giving a platform to RT, a mouthpiece for Putin? Russia has unleashed a nerve agent here in Britain &amp; 3 people, including a police officer, have been fighting for their lives. Hope other panellists walk out in disgust https://t.co/ndFtxGYRbm < - > @sarahwollaston @bbcquestiontime I disagree with you. Why shouldn't we hear what they've got to say? Do you think the people are too stupid to assess correctly what's being said? Personally I trust the people's collective judgement far more than the Establishment and politicians.
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > you're lucky we're awesome, but one of these days you're gonna get your face broken -.-
Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight. < - > You also continue to be wrong and, as far as I can tell, are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position.
Thank you thank you thank you and THANK YOU to all all the kids who involved themselves in #NationalWalkoutDay ... its time for a change and to end all of these tragic shootings ✊🏼 < - > @badzachx we didnt really have a walkout because they were saying how its sort of an invitation for something bad to happen (which i disagree with) and they did tell us we would be suspended if we did. but what happened was all the students from our school are writing letters
My response today to PM Theresa May's statement on the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. A firm and fair stance must be taken. https://t.co/P5p5Fnn4xR < - > @IanBlackfordMP Sorry Ian, don't agree. This whole affair is "suspect" in the extreme. Read up on the alternative views. Sad you and SNP think this is a sound position to take. Did you not think that your submission to UK Gov. is ONE reason we can look to MI5/6 instead?

This Telegraph article highlights the NPOV problem with this article. < - > I was just thinking that the article is really more POV in the anti-Catholic direction because of the serious lack of commentary on the multitude of charities and good works accomplished around the world.
Sister Of Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Arrested After Menacing Social Media Post https://t.co/Hi2jK7suer < - > @NPR While i don't agree with her racist nature. There was no direct threat in her comment. Proclaiming "i hope you get shot" is not the same as im going to shoot you.

Our factual article will actually help disperse misperceptions bred by the popular media if we can just make it NPOV and stick to the actual facts. < - > (Gosh did I really use the word ''fact'' over five times just now - that is why I need Xandar here - I cant speak English!)Good Granny again!
Today in /r/NASCAR, Jacoby's girlfriend isn't really pregnant https://t.co/pQWwEoh6wB < - > @Brian_Fletcher I don’t disagree that one day she’s going to wake up next to a 30 year old dressing up in a firesuit and have a wtf moment and leave
Anyone interested? < - > Sigh, no can do - my weekends are all booked up these days.
Maybe these things are of interest to people but lets give the real and full story and not just the propaganda.The real stroy is that the tank is part of Glory Memorial Complex which is home to the graves of the brave ones killed by Moldovan soilders during the war for independence and where the eternal flame burns in their memory. < - > Dont lie This Tank was here long before 1992.

Am sure there are about 10-12’000 fans that have stopped going to PR would disagree that the “majority” of fans are supportive of him. Is he aiming for 3000 that support him? #idiot
I actually think the #Cowboys have played free agency right so far. The key for them, as always, is to make a few smart signings in the next two weeks. < - > @Marcus_Mosher Have to disagree. Nolan carol, Cedric Thornton, &amp; benson mayowa were all considered “smart” signings. They were all a waste of money and are no longer on the team . I understand being economical, but we Have to have a balance with FA bargain shopping , and relying on the draft.
Hate at this pathological level demands explanation beyond the obvious low intelligence. I suggest that Godnuts are secretly unconfident of their beliefs &amp; mortally terrified they might be wrong. This translates into hyper-extreme hate of anyone who credibly boosts their doubts. https://t.co/2DBlX5b9RS < - > @RichardDawkins I completely agree with you on your point about the godnuts. In addition, don't you love when they say "I'm not judging" just before or after they've rendered a judgment such as saying they expect someone is in "hell?"

Here's something it's possible to disagree with a politician and still vote for a their political party .  If said political party was doing something that's was detrimental to the country for example putting more people into poverty . Then time to reconsider voting for them. < - > If said political party releases a standard reaction on something they have very little information about other than  what they are being told by those who supposedly do. We can say we disagree and still vote for said Party . That's my tuppence worth  Disagree with me ? https://t.co/YSZAg2zCja

We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know! < - > @realDonaldTrump You obviously have never read, or don't understand the way trade agreements work. Deficits can be a good thing, when dealing with complex trade.  What specifically do you disagree with? Please give more details, instead of blanketed statements.
I would appreciate if you would reframe from calling me a racist. < - > It seems, no matter how much sourcing or facts I provide, I cannot generate any response from critics other than personal attacks about racism or Wikipedia history.

Omitting the scandals is in keeping with the historical perspective encouraged by WP:LEAD. < - > Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD.
Murty’s done a fine job, but we (fans, board, etc.) should always be striving for better. Personally thought Sunday magnified his inexperience, particularly in the second-half.  Forget sentiment. If there’s a better manager out there that’s keen, we have to go for him. < - > @NewcoTed He’s getting better and better, I disagree I would extend his contract today. Look at the shambles he took on, give him the summer and a run at a full season 🇬🇧
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > I can see your point and it makes complete sense to me. However, I think we will be hit over the head a few times if we dont have any controversies noted in the lead.
He's taking a radical position in the god-no god debate (if you believe in God, you're a crank.) So if he's going to be included, it seems fair to me to include some radical stuff from the other side of the debate. < - > I completely disagree with your claim that Sam Harris is radical, extremist or any of those other designations. Sam Harris assumes an activist role, but it most certainly isn't outside the mainstream.
The new English reformation paragraph could readYou still get the message that Catholics were persecuted and that some Protestants were persecuted, but without unnecessary details that swing it toward pro-Catholic POV. < - > Changing it will make it POV anti-Catholic and factually lacking.
''you seem to have already decided for yourself what you think atheism is'' - I would say that my understanding of atheism seems wholly supported by the majority of sources presented, I would have to ask why it is that your understanding is different. < - > Well, I've read the sources.

If Canada has strong national ties to any date format it is to YYYY-MM-DD, which appears on a great many official Canadian government documents and websites (and is also the easiest to sort and shortest to write). < - > Suggesting that Canada somehow has strong national ties to ISO because you found some instances where it is used there is silly. It is used quite a lot in US military and certain US academic circles; does that somehow mean ISO has strong US ties?
Tonight I’m letting my 25lb 16week old child sleep in my bed with me.

We have agreed to disagree 😛. Pyrs are such characters 💜
Um, Britain and France declared war on Germany as a direct result of their guarantees to Poland, do you not recall the British ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from Poland? < - > The guaranty to some country is not an alliance.
Wassap, I don't see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short. < - > I - for one - do not think this article is NPOV.
Perhaps 'The USSR joined the war against the Axis' might be a better phrasing? < - > Saying that the USSR joined the war against the Axis is a bit confusing: this implies that it made an active decision to join the war when in fact it was invaded (and taken by surprise) and the USSR only fought the countries which had invaded it.
Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.-- < - > Paul, this is apparent amateur revisionism is tiresome.
Before a bunch of snot nosed kids walk out of school to attack the NRA &amp; firearms, maybe they should learn about the subject first?

These clearly have different meanings. < - > Zionist regime and Zionist entity are one and the same.
Perhaps you could do us the courtesy of specifying where WP:CITE contradicts Template:Cite book, OR says anything about not having accessdates. I've looked pretty thoroughly, and all I see is that is not listed as COMMON for books with no url to begin with. < - > There is a contradiction, though: WP:CITE#Links and ID numbers says, ''For web-only sources with no publication date you should include a ''Retrieved'' date instead, in case the webpage changes in the future.'' (Emphasis added.) The ''Web pages'' subsection of ''Examples'', and only that subsection, lists among things typically to be included ''the date you retrieved it (required if the publication date is unknown)''.

Again, Neilsen is talking mostly about agnosticism there, and the contrast with ''the atheist'' does not clearly state whether he means ALL atheists or a subgroup of atheists (or even the singular) - as such, presenting it as definitional of atheism is telling the wiki-reader to read too much into it. < - > Given that Nielsen has not indicated that he uses 'an atheist' differently than 'an agnostic' and that he is clearly talking about all agnostics in using that phrasing I would say that you are probably reading too much into it, or at least bear the burden of an extraordinary claim.

May didn’t go far enough; Corbyn thinks she went too far. This sense of political homelessness is getting ridiculous. < - > @mrjamesob Corbyn said no such thing, he said nothing about May's measures.

"I still think this Manchester United side need three or four world-class players."  "They need to spend more."  Nearly £300m spent on players under José Mourinho and Steven Gerrard thinks they're still lacking quality. https://t.co/NMVYXaIF4t < - > @btsportfootball Disagree, Utd have a very strong team but under Mourinho any flair and confidence they have is coached out of them so they effectively become 10 wheelie bins.

I read this section on the reasoning for not creating a ''personal life'' section and still don't see why a personal life section has not been created. < - > Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability.

There may be additional fictional forces as well due to the coordinate system you pick, but that's not the same thing at all. < - > Once again, all fictitious forces are ''coordinate dependent things'', so your comment is a complete non-sequitur.
RT @USUN: Let me make one thing clear from the start, the United States stands in absolute solidarity with Great Britain.

I've never met or talked to Angele. I have with other Participants such as Johnny and Nate and if they stand by her then thats good enough for me. If I was the sheriff  would be thankful for her opening up my eyes to the jails flaws from all areas < - > @imtherealsheri I have to respectfully disagree with you on that one. She don’t seem to respect the very reason she was there, right from day one. The only info she could offer is that the girls “get down” in their rooms. I’m sure this isn’t new info

I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia. < - > It wouldn't be 'adopting a very strict version of neutrality', it would be adopting an incorrect misinterpretation of the policy, one that is specifically outlined as incorrect in the policy.

@TonyHWindsor Tony - what are our 'leaders' thinking? Dutton meets with a pro-gun lobbyist in Feb &amp; now thinking of a “firearms advisory council” to give gun lobby “a seat at the table” to advise govt on firearms policy. Last year PM rejects Indigenous advisory council. WTF? < - > @RBD926 With all due respect I don't agree with the premise of your statement ...we don't have any 'leaders' and the people who call themselves 'leaders' haven't thought for a long time , if ever .

So far, you have repeatedly said that everything necessary has already been provided by you. However, your criteria for clear and documented presentation falls a bit short for the Great Unwashed. < - > As has already been explained repeatedly and at length, the references you mentioned (along with many others) explicitly support what I'm saying, and contradict what you are saying. I've pointed out that you mis-understand and therefore mis-represent those references.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity.
Wikipedia isn't about negative information and positive information, it's just information. < - > If Bush's front page for example is going to mention nice little subtlely negative implications and the controversies and criticisms surrounding his policies, and on just about every part of his bio, Obama's should too.

I think people are waking up to the truth about your failings.

Contrary to popular belief, Buddhism is NOT a religion nor a philosophy. < - > The consensus view in scholarship is that Buddhism is essentially religion, which is often qualified in some way, so as to not lead people to believe that it is the same notion of religion as in Abrahamic religions.

Those are major issues, and criticism of his positions on those issues is notable.Just off a random google search, something like: Gitmo or Obamacare —Preceding unsigned comment added byThere are two ways to fix the inequality, have no criticisms in any article or have them in both articles. < - > It just doesn't work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama's article against not only other presidents, but all of his political rivals, those of heads of state of other countries, and so on.

If they are going to mention the criticism of the Bush policies or things he ''allegedly'' did or didn't do, which they make sure they included on his front page, then do it with Obama and his policies, on his front page. < - > You don't balance out articles by putting the same amount of criticism in one because this much is in the other, anymore than you determine how many characters, pictures or quotes appear in each article.
Seriously though the dollar sign alone, as its symbolism was used in Atlas Shrugged, is the best choice. < - > Atlas Shrugged is hardly a cornerstone of capitalism.

The New York Times was and still is considered one of the most accurate news publications in existence (have you, by any chance, ever read an issue?), instead of a conveniently unnamed westerner who you claim is biased against Muslims but still likes to blame Armenians. < - > The NY Times was working off of this same propaganda -- reports that came to Westerners from Armenians in the West, and were often further exaggerated by the Europeans.

Making a blanket statement that you will not honor the community consensus, regardless of what it is, is probably not going to be helpful to you or your position, and throws up a major red flag in terms of your ability to engage in wikipedia productively. I would suggest rephrasing the question yourself, right here, instead, as being a rather more productive avenue. < - > That's a misrepresentation of what I have said. I will not support this RFC - this has nothing to do with ''honoring community consensus''.
I had a lot of comments beyond the two that Nancy pulled out to ask for consensus about, and I thought it would be easier for those working to update the article to put those with any other PR comments than have them here on the talk page. < - > Yeah, but now if someone new does look at the peer review page they may decide taht since it appears to have already been reviewed, they may as well look at some other article.

I thus suggest that we create a second disclaimer, such as, ''The following statistical resources may be created by those with a non-neutral position in the abortion debate.'' Site such sites as the AGI and Johnston's Archive, unfortunately, fall into a grey area between purely neutral parties and clear-cut advocacy groups. < - > I'm skeptical about listing them as biased when the other organizations there are clearly pushing one or the other agenda, whereas most of what AGI does is research.
The point is that when you make a pipe, you don't call the link ''an oil rig'' and then link to a specific named rig. < - > As to your point about piping, I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic.

In dynamics the coordinate systems are four-dimensional, including a time dimension. < - > You amaze me by suggesting that the fact time is a coordinate has a role in all this. You also wander off-topic to repeat how impeccable your arguments always are blah-blah. Here is the question you raised: So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other? And here is the rub: there are two usages of ''fictitious force''. In the approach of Stommel and Moore, in a inertial frame there are fictitious forces if (and only if) you use curvilinear coordinates. On the other hand, in a non-inertial frame there are ''additional'' fictitious forces due to acceleration of the frame relative to an inertial frame. The quotations I have provided (with links where you can read the entire discussion surrounding these quotes) provide their discussion for the case of polar coordinates. Despite this answer to your question, I am sure you will say that I have misread Stommel and Moore, but that you will not go into any detail why that is so. Instead, you will wander off and explain your noble quest for sanity in a desert of ignorance.

During the National School Walkout, a student at New Prague High School in Minnesota held a sign that said: “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.”  A student at the school said, "he was escorted off the property by our principal &amp; threatened to be put into a police car." https://t.co/1V6eaL0eRi < - > @RealSaavedra FASCISTS!

When we're in the middleground of sources, which perhaps spans from Fox News and Wall Street Journal on the right to Time Magazine and Salon.com on the left, we still have to look to see whether it's an editorial opinion piece, commentary, analysis, rhetorical flourish, interview, whatever. < - > If you ask me, it's somewhat uncivil to equate Fox News and Wall Street Journal to Time Magazine and Salon.com. If Time equals Wall Street Journal on opposite sides, then does Salon equals Fox News?
I might be being harsh but I find @JennieGow incredibly annoying....she waffles on and really doesn’t know much about motorsport...dribbles on...one of those that has lucked into her position...I can think of numerous female presenters that know that’s sport much better #rubbish < - > @ScottSt76259662 @JennieGow Scott, I really don't agree.

I support the students and teachers on #NationalWalkoutDay. This is what change looks like. < - > @jimmyfallon Ehhh I disagree... change is action , walking out to say "we want change" doesn't change anything.

If you want to say that a particular view is the ''consensus'', then you need sources that demonstrate that it is the consensus. I haven't seen any. < - > I can't prove a the majority of an unbounded set, but I can state that for the set currently available to us the case seems made that the majority of them do support the usage in EBC: ''atheism is a positive denial''.
I know this is a touchy area, and ''Negro'' is also a word which is considered offensive for historical reasons, however I think we need a better title, and one that corresponds better with ''African Americans''... < - > One issue with changing the title to reflect African origin is that not all groups labeled ''black'' are connected to Africa. The last sentence of the intro reads: Other definitions of the term Black extend to any of the populations characterized by dark skin, a definition that also includes certain populations in Oceania, Southeast Asia.[1][2].
So it’s been nearly 12 hours since the #MarchForOurLives walkout ended. The adult freak out continues, and that’s making me wonder who the children are... Kids protesting shouldn’t be this upsetting... Kids were better citizens today than many adults. < - > @Montel_Williams And many of these “kids” will be voting in November. Some from their college dorms, some from home, and some from half a world away fighting to keep these “adults” free. It’s convenient to call the children when you disagree. But they are adult enough to die for you.
Hip-hop has always been the lowest common denominator when it comes to music. Punk as well, but I listened to both because they had a point of view that fucked with the mainstream narrative. Now both genres simply fall in line. The only anti-establishment left is you and me. < - > @DaytonDoes When you say "lowest common denominator" regarding the music, do you mean like technically? If so I'd have to disagree, unless you can prove to me you can play guitar like East Bay Ray.  ...&amp; If you can, why are we not in a band already?

I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise). < - > ''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.

Perhaps 'The USSR joined the war against the Axis' might be a better phrasing? < - > Saying that the USSR joined the war against the Axis is a bit confusing: this implies that it made an active decision to join the war when in fact it was invaded (and taken by surprise) and the USSR only fought the countries which had invaded it.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.

So it’s been nearly 12 hours since the #MarchForOurLives walkout ended. The adult freak out continues, and that’s making me wonder who the children are... Kids protesting shouldn’t be this upsetting... Kids were better citizens today than many adults. < - > @Montel_Williams I started my activism career anti #VietnamWar protester- ended it being the only Jewish broadcaster chasing terrorism to protect American Homeland. I believe we should allow these kids to be activists, watch them become our nation's leaders whether we agree or disagree.

The newly edited introduction for this article sounds too ambiguous and it severely lacks succinctness and conciseness. I think when people want to quickly read information about a specific topic, they don't want an obscurely dull and time consuming introduction that explains why capitalism is difficult to define. < - > It is a complicated topic.
I was just told by my math teacher that #NationalWalkoutDay will accomplish nothing and I won’t understand the complexity of this issue until I’m an adult &amp; fully “mature.” Yeah, right... < - > @JaclynCorin Well, it won’t. Because the leaders of your movements have called names and other things to those who simply disagree.  You have to change the victimhood mentality of the left before change occurs. Also, you have to admit, the FBI has failed to do checks properly.
It doesn't matter how Atheists were defining atheism - let me make that absolutely clear.

I have enough good faith to assume that editors commenting on this issue have read into it, and are not blindly agreeing with Dominus without considered opinions of their own. If you disagree with Dominus' assessment, the correct avenue is to either present alternate arguments in opposition to his, or to propose an alternate phrasing with a clear explanation of what issues the new phrasing corrects. Saying you refuse to accept community consensus without first making any effort to correct these perceived problems is bad form. < - > Same comment to your comment. Arguments resulting from misrepresentation have no relevance. You also do not understand my position with respect to reaching consensus, which does not include RFCs at this point for stated reasons.

Capitalism is a descriptive term not an ideology. It means that the means of production are privately owned. Whether the owners allow free markets or enforce monopolies, or get the government to subsidize or own loss-making industries like public transit makes no difference. < - > I wasn't suggesting that it was an ideology. I was talking about the definition and academic understanding of ''what is capitalism?'' It's not simply a ''descriptive term,'' and it's not necessarily true that, in a capitalist economic system, the means of production are privately owned.

The snapshot of the arguments has been presented by the proposer of the RfC in a simplified and misleading way to the extent that the well was poisoned.

Your proposal, by glossing over what went on during the Reformation, (see for example Prayer Book Rebellion, dissolution of the monasteries), is actually more POV in showing only Catholics as persecutors. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.

2012 vs 2018. At this rate I’m going to be an alarmingly attractive MILF. https://t.co/5q5CcEMCWz < - > @pagesixtynine I don't disagree with you on that.
Retrieved 15 December 2011.  Discussion Which puts Encyclopædia Britannica Concise at odds with the Encyclopædia Britannica that you were quoting on December 4, which goes on to say: Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons... < - > They are not at odds, and EB states the exact same delineation between agnosticism and atheism, the problem is that you are misreading ''rejects'' - and failing to account for noncognitivism which is the basis for preferring rejects over ''false'' - but they ( as Nielsen makes clear in contrasting agnosticism and atheism ) reduce to the same thing by different routes.
I wish I could relate. Im like the last born that isn't really the last born. Mxm. https://t.co/sWby0oLMG8 < - > My siblings would probably disagree though 🙄

The ambiguity belonged to the other dominions; Canada was at the forefront of getting the Balfour Declaration accepted and the Statute of Westminster passed, and, unlike Australia and New Zealand, who delayed for years, accepted it as law as soon as was possible. < - > You'll need to back up this story with references.
By the way, the fact that it's obvious to everyone that this material exists to ''debunk the creationist ''2nd law'' claim'' is why I think it should be moved to the section on creation vs. < - > Really this is two misunderstandings mixed up together, one about the 2nd law in general and another about the application of the 2nd law to biological processes.
This discussion about the use of the word ''deportations'' is over as far as I am concerned. < - > And I certainly don't regard the discussion as closed just because you say so and I think others need to weigh in on this.

I disagree w/ Manchin on guns but share his humanity.
Wikt:practical: ''Being likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation; able to be put to use.'' I cannot fathom how Astronomy fits that definition, or will fit that definition until humanity gains an advantage from it aside from the theoretical (theory being the antonym). < - > But, the finiteness of the speed of light is indeed ''likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation'', namely to the creation of theories about stellar and galactic evolution.

i bet you that they'd fucking snap to like nervous fucking field mice in the eyes of a hungry hawk. < - > No offense, but I don't think australia telling israel to do anything would have any effect.
Why do some women compete with men ??  Tbh I’m proud to be a woman and if I’m constantly focused on what men have then that means I see a deficiency in myself.  It means I see myself as lacking in a certain area and that a ‘man’ has it so called “better” than I do < - > There is acctually no point dabbling into feminism on here, so agree to disagree but my rights have been given to me and I take them for what they are alhamduliah Allah SWT has raised our status as women
NEW YORK POST: Actor Matt Damon moving his family to Australia because he is 'fed up with President Trump' < - > @joshdcaplan We don’t want him here! Anyone who leaves their Country simply because they disagree with their current President is a tool. Australia &amp; the US are the closest of allies, if he thinks he is getting away from POTUS here, lol WRONG!
If the #Giants sit at #2 and DON'T secure their future franchise QB, they are absolutely out their minds. As tantalizing as Barkley is, QB is the only play.   Have to brush sentimentality aside, sadly. #NFLDraft2018 < - > @BrandonTierney Couldn't disagree more. Team is in win now mode. Should the team fall apart again in '18 and have a high draft pick, the opportunity will present itself again.  Also, DG has a lot of faith in Davis Webb. So, I wouldn't dismiss him just yet either...#Giants
This implies the mindset that it's some external force influencing them, that they need to just pray against it or something. < - > It's ''pray against it, search your soul for what you have done and how to change, and take steps to rectify the wrongs and stop doing evil in order to keep the Devil at bay.''  Catholic doctrine doesn't allow ''the Devil'' as a ''get out of responsibility free'' card.
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state (it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government) so clearly they can not be interchangable. < - > But saying that the zionist regime and the zionist entity are distinct is wrong.
I get what you’re saying but it was a 20 point game in the 4th quarter so it’s not that exciting. https://t.co/u6j3fxbps5 < - > @_Philly_Talk Gus Johnson would disagree

Found this meme. It may be the worst meme ever. It's certainly the worst one I've seen. https://t.co/J8EudjknhB < - > @amazingatheist Anyone who puts tard on the end of something is truly the pinnacle of human stupidity.  It's like "Eyyy look at me, I fused a word to describe people I disagree with and then put TARD on the end of it, you know, cause RETARD!!!! Owww me so funny".
A dog is not a living thing just like me. Dogs are creatures, and they're fun and cute and nice. They are also infinitely less valuable than humans. https://t.co/a2C4fq5l10 < - > @michaeljknowles I usually agree with you but not on your attitude towards animals. Yes, animals are less valuable than humans, but they are living creatures made by God..Our treatment of them says a lot about how we value and respect life. It does not mean they are on the same level as humans.
I think these kids need to stay in school: https://t.co/Q01Hc7fQ80 < - > @MarkSimoneNY I disagree. They are clearly unable to learn anything constructive. It’s time for them to learn a useful trade. If that doesn’t work out, we will always need ditch diggers and trash collectors.
Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous, I'm still excited. < - > Next week's is probably going to be a disaster.

I constantly wonder why I even bother doing work, making an effort, and putting things together.  If you're going to fuck up my work, waste my time, don't even bother making me do something? Like, for fuck's sake.  I'm tired of this happening all the time? < - > That's not to say I don't understand why; I don't disagree with the reason behind it, but honestly?  If you're going to force me to up and change everything I do at your beck and call or based on whatever whim you're having at that moment, don't make me do it.
It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations, with the total number of Armenian deaths generally held to have been between one and one-and-a-half million persons. < - > forcd marches through desert areas without food/water etc) - and the claim of such (deportaion) - is entirely false - and referencing the cover story ''techir Law'' - is in fact a cover up of the (well proven) attempt at extermination and political-cultural anhiliation of the minority Armenian population through means that included (among other methods) uprooting/forced marches (of largely de-maleized populations) as well as direct massacre beyond the sight of outsiders - and these things occured in an entirely organized and massive scale throughout Anatolia - though primarily - but not limited to - the Eastern (Armenian) provinces of the Ottoman Empire.
The fact that Eliot admits that ''it is not clear'' and makes ambiguous claims about what is ''little known in the Far East'', tells me this is not important enough to mention. < - > It's perfectly clear that the phrase ''It is not clear'' refers to the Path being taught to lay people, not to the next sentence.
Some bishops demonstrably knew about the allegations of misconduct but then reassigned the accused rather than report them to the police immediately. < - > As I stated to you on my talk page, I am not OK with deleting information about the prevailing psychology saying people could be cured of this behaviour, that many of the deviant priests received counseling before being reassigned, or the statement by John Paul II in response to this information.

I will also note that Brews' identification of other viewpoints with Lagrangian formalism is skewed, and shows that he still does not understand the other points of view described in the numerous reputable references that have been cited here. < - > Please support your statement that my view is skewed.
So that's why it discusses the Spanish inquisition, the Algerian war, and the Khmer Rouge? < - > Actually, it mostly discusses CIA or American use during the Bush years (although now not mostly referring to him by name); the others are mentioned either historically or almost en passant as other repressive regimes.
Seriously it's been a very rough few days because I said sexism exists in Ag. Thanks to the ppl sending dms and tweets like this.

Feel fee to tag me anytime you need an ally #inthistogether we may disagree on many things, we may agree on others, but at the core is the reality that women in ag face sexism and its time we talked about it openly.
And let me repeat what I said about argumentum e silentio. If a source fails to mention an alleged basic fact, it's reasonable to conclude that it doesn't believe in it. < - > You are prevented by the policy against original research from stating such a conclusion in the article.
These students’ signs at the Capitol are EVERYTHING. 🙌 #NationalWalkOutDay https://t.co/DNTiPHu2iU < - > @CAPAction Start sentencing people in possession of unlicensed gun to AT LEAST 20yrs, no early release EVER. The possession laws now are WEAK. Repeat violent offenders often have multiple possession charges. Apologists &amp; Enablers will disagree.
It's not just a readability aspect, they actually look worse. < - > And honestly, if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice, I'd probably at least consider using Safari; the stuff is more typographically ''correct'' using that rendering, which in the context of an image of a site may well look better.

You originally said you deleted because the claim was not in Scott's paper. < - > It's place in the source is clear only to someone who has the full source in front of them; Scott's assertion about the end of Canada's Dominion status coming on 7 September 1939 certainly isn't in the link you provided. Regardless, the claim was presented in the article not as Scott's theory but as a widely accepted fact. I think the claim is audacious precisely because I've seen no other sources say anything even remotely similar.

Two words: French hours. We do it on most of my projects. 10 hour days with no lunch break but food constantly circulating on set. Hard out at the end of 10 hours. People drive home awake and see their families. I am working to let this become an option for all US productions. https://t.co/ozmpDcL9u3 < - > @paulfeig @audreyalison Disagree. Those of us not allowed to leave set shouldn’t have to sacrifice our lunch break because production can’t make their days shorter. Extend schedule don’t make workers give up breaks. It’s not about the food, it’s about the needed rest break.
Just over half the people in this country no longer believe in the principles this country was founded upon. Freedom and limited government.  This country is not united and can't be united. And won't ever be united again. < - > @WalshFreedom I don't agree with everything you discuss but this topic I feel you are right on! We will never be united again. #SeparateTheUSA
In a moment when so many exist in political echochambers, @KirstenPowers and I believe that dialogue is powerful. Which is why we invited Eric—to understand how a large portion of America thinks. If you value these kinds of conversations, we think you’ll enjoy it! https://t.co/2e4tTxEWFR < - > @JonathanMerritt @KirstenPowers I'm sure the podcast is going to be great.

The Senator made his concerns known during a press conference at the Capitol. https://t.co/n9W0fFUHRL < - > @SarahPalinUSA I don't agree with his reasons.
I am sick and tired of social media trolling and bullying. It is important to stand up for what we believe in, but surely we can achieve this through courtesy, decency &amp; respect rather than using social media as a pitchfork. Social media abuse has to stop. Stay classy everyone. < - > @JamesMelville I partly disagree. The Suffragettes had to use forceful tactics to be heard. Drag Queens had to kick off to get gay rights on the map. Sometimes the crime is that society doesn't listen to polite requests for change. If important issues are ignored, people shout louder.
Modern Basque is not ''pre-Indo-European'' unless it hasn't changed since (Proto-)Indo-European began being spoken. < - > Dumu, I'm not sure how you figure we can't say with a fair amount of certainty it's pre-IE.
Maybe these things are of interest to people but lets give the real and full story and not just the propaganda.The real stroy is that the tank is part of Glory Memorial Complex which is home to the graves of the brave ones killed by Moldovan soilders during the war for independence and where the eternal flame burns in their memory. < - > Mark, yours may well be the version of the story taught to Transnistrian kindergarteners.
This should shock no one.  In elections, the Green Party has been nothing more than a Dem spoiler for nearly two decades. https://t.co/H0YuljLGnu < - > @HoarseWisperer I agree with you most times.  But I don't here.  You can't blame the left for voting for the Green party when they embrace Clinton and Kaine.  I went ahead and voted for Hillary.  But she basically told progressives to fuck off.  They were going for the moderate vote.
He'll never figure out why this is a self-own https://t.co/JAc88fdzRL < - > @notwokieleaks I disagree.

Keep up the good fight, David!
Also the term ''modern'' is entirely POV too in the ''modern'' day the Church has 1,130,000,000 followers, modern people, who by choice of their faith do not agree with killing unborn babies either. < - > I was OK with the sentence, I took it to mean issues that have just been brought up in the Modern era as opposed to issues like heresy in the Roman empire age.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR In the 60s and 70s, many participated in protests, and issues of the day were topics covered in Civics class.

The major civil rights historians (David Garrow, Taylor Branch, Adam Fairclough) know that this data is accurate, and Garrow even proofread further manuscripts. < - > I observe again that neither Branch nor Garrow has written anything anywhere that might be understood to express the view that Bevel was even nearly as important as King and/or far more important than any other civil right movement leader besides King.
I'm one of Labour's strongest critics of Vladimir Putin - but Corbyn was right today. https://t.co/UHmQcWXrCw < - > @paulmasonnews For arguments sake, is there anything that you would disagree with Corbyn on?  So far there has not been one single view or decision that you have disagreed with.  Which means you just tribally support him blindly. Which means your views can’t be taken objectively.

You know what would create a REAL change?  If all the kids that walked out to “protest” gun violence yesterday came together &amp; stopped allowing bullies to pick on other students.  But showing kindness &amp; doing something nice like that wouldn’t be very trendy, would it? < - > @Education4Libs @Here2seejustice I disagree about. Bullies are part of life. When I was a kid everyone had a bully at some point. But you reach deep inside yourself and you stand up, and maybe you get beat up and maybe you don't, but you learn a very important lesson. It's part of what makes you who you are

You fuckers saying Stephen Hawking is "free" from his wheelchair now: Disabled people are here, reading your tweets. Do you think we ought to die? Cause that's what you're saying, actually.  Don't you dare try to sell death as freedom.

It has nothing to do with the fucking chair. Calm down.
Fictitious forces are fictitious. < - > No, fictitious forces cannot kill you. What kills you is the actual (absolute) acceleration to which you are subjected, and this actual absolute acceleration is proportional to the applied actual forces. Fictitious forces do not contribute at all to your absolute acceleration. Your comment is the kind of misunderstanding that I'm trying to eliminate from the article, by insisting that it be written clearly and correctly.

Nope. The more we learn, the more we know. "The more we learn the less we think we know" is New Age nonsense. Even when what we're outlining are new domains of inquiry, those are known unknowns. https://t.co/htcfe4tvXa < - > @omriceren Wrong. While I completely disagree with Singer's religion take, the first part is correct. Every new discovery shows us how little of the world we know (in my field, biology for instance).
I need EVERYONE living Tulare county to share this.  I was on my way to the DMV in Tulare when this heartless act against a human being. Keep in mind this individual was not armed.

And her hack can be interrupted if she has taken damage @PlayOverwatch Are you going you add the same disadvantages to Tracer &amp;  widomaker? take damage cant blink?
You can make all of those same points of contention about the Holocaust, the only difference is that Turkey still retains the same racist culture, whereas Germany has changed, and refrains from further ruining its reputation by insulting its victims. < - > Germany did not come to terms with its genocide because they wanted to, they were forced to do so after being defeated.

Rihanna ''allegedly'' getting beat up by Chris Brown is not trivial either, seeing as it directly intertwined with her career (as in cancelling an appearance and bruising her face/body, which are essential to her career). < - > Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability.

One final note, though - there's nothing special about the population density of the Gaza strip, which is similar to (and actually lower than many) other urban areas in the world. < - > The Gaza population density is 4118/km2 which is ranked the 2nd densest urban area in the world.
It is therefore sensible, even for the sceptical argument, to make brief, objectively reported reference to the notable criticisms, and to give reference to other sources that detail them more fully. To not give some kind of representation feeds right into the hands of conspiracy theorists. < - > Serious criticisms are published in other peer reviewed journals, not in astrology fanzines - that has been the entire point of almost every oppose in this RfC.
unpopular opinion: the cl*ver g*rls annoy me and i hate when they’re in smosh videos < - > @handwrittenhaas Honey, an unpopular opinion is when people will disagree with what you have you say. You can't disagree with a fact. I totally agree with u
Mueller Said To Be ‘Close To Completion’ Of Trump Obstruction Probe https://t.co/GqCwKl92rk < - > @true_pundit Sorry, but I disagree with this article. I'm with Judge Napolitano on this one... that Mueller is in no way even close to the end of his investigation. This article is wishful thinking.
Against my better judgment, I just started reading a Spectator profile of Steve Bannon where he goes on about how great Mussolini is, wholly unchallenged by the interviewer, and then I reached this line and you have got to be kidding me. This is the interviewer, btw. https://t.co/04Kk1Soyll < - > @alexvtunzelmann @davies_will ‘Against my better judgement’ bull. You actively seek out media you disagree with as its dopamine stimulating and you can then try to write a clever tweet about it afterwards. Liked by all your lefty circle friends 😄😄
why the heck did barstool naz block me when I just disagreed w/ them 😂 < - > This is a free country. We are allowed to disagree.
However, I can understand their motivations, in that they are wishing to ''humanize'' and ''personalize'', abortion, and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images. < - > (I dispute that this is a ''functional'' tactic, as you put it; for various reasons, it almost invariably backfires on the anti-abortionist who presents the image.
The relevence to the rest of the world and its media, including places where the religion is more present, is highly questionable''. < - > The scandals have not been covered only in the US (nor have they occured only in the US).
A midfield two of Kante and Fabregas has never been the best combination in big games this season, hope they both put in a shift tonight < - > @nbsulymanFC Disagree they've both played together before and Chelsea won the match, get your facts right
I think that B qualifies as a ''Practical effect'' of A, or even better as a ''Practical consequence'', or, if you like, as a ''Useful consequence'', or as a ''Useful effect'', or as a ''Useful application''. < - > I guess this is what happens when you come to a page frequented by science geeks (not an insult: I'm one too). The ability to measure a distant star is considered ''practical'' on the same level as everyday usage of a computer or a GPS.

Keep going with this, because it needs to be exposed and out there in the public domain. Your doing a very important job.

Loath as I am to defend United Airlines, people: stop bringing your dogs everywhere. They don't belong on airplanes, they don't belong in restaurants. Fee-Fee will survive for an hour or two without you. If you aren't blind, leave the dog at home. < - > @michaeljknowles MK, must disagree. Pets become part of a family.  They travel well in the appropriate crate and I pay a large price for the space when we travel with our dog.  We also board him at home of travel does not make sense. Restaurants is another story.

The child sex abuse scandal and the abuse of aboriginal people is very significant to the Roman Catholic Church. < - > Yes, this article plainly needs more of that sort of thing.
A picture of an aborted fetus might be useful in the fetus article, but not here. < - > I think not.
If, as some people assert (I don't know whether you're one of them), Buddhism is all about the 4 NT, why do so many standard textbooks not say so? Don't you think it's a rather fundamental fact about the subject that you'd expect them to mention? In fact I haven't been able to find any scholar who says so explicitly enough to be cited as a source on WP. < - > I agree with nearly everything you say here, PJ except for the very last. if a textbook fails to make a statement about what ''Buddhism'' as a whole ''is'' we cannot assume that they aren't convinced by any claims they've heard. We can only assume that they have nothing to say on the subject. This is a huge distinction in my eyes.

So the consensus on my feed is that animals shouldn't be looked after because teenagers are THAT much more important.  Wow, just wow.   Please don't post any more cute animal tweets. Since you don't care about their welfare. < - > Clarification: People are important. Gun control is an important issue (even if I don't agree on many points). But if you insist animals aren't, I hope Dana, Crowder, &amp; the like have a field day with you.
I think the inclusion of the Hiberno-English tag is great progress as it looks like a somewhat acceptance of the reality that British Isles is simply the name for the group of islands. < - > But it's a lie, because the article is written in British English. Is there any text anywhere in the world written in Hiberno English?
As you say, this is logically and statistically supported - that's good science. < - > It is a baseless, uneducated opinion.
Software developers, remember that being an engineer means that you....  1) Adhere to a code of professional ethics. 2) Avoid oral tradition as a primary teaching method. 3) Participate often in rigorous communities of practice.  4) Only work for orgs that embrace safety culture. < - > @practicingdev It's not that I disagree, it's that this has been something that I really saw in my electrical engineering degree program and haven't seen at all since I started working in software, which means that #1 is basically impossible. Can I see an example of #1?

This is relevant to the article because the original comments were questioning why there was no real coverage of savants. < - > Look, as far as your POV about AS and giftedness/difficulties the sources agree with you. But that's all we need to say: ''what do the sources say?'' The point had already been made in the discussion and that should have been the end of it.

We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know! < - > @realDonaldTrump As a Canadian I have to disagree with you, Mr President, when you say Justin Trudeau of Canada is a "very good guy" - he is in fact the very opposite!

Karanacs, surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven't previously been involved in editing an article? < - > I'm not one of the main editors even though I argue here a lot; my content contributions have been very very narrowly focused although I've done a lot of copyediting.
Or how he said it Kermit Just looks kool I thought Brian Henson voiced Kermit now. < - > Brian Henson as Kermit is just a popular misconception.
Democrats are enraged about Bernie Sanders leading a youth movement.

And I'm in the heart of Trump country.
'I will always remember you' is the most bullshit thing people say to console themselves. The only thing that matters is companionship. If you are not there with someone, everything that was, becomes futile and you don't give a flying fuck about them in some time. < - > A lot of people disagree with me because they hold love in very high regard but Companionship &gt; Love The only thing that matters in the end is, who stays and who leaves. Everything else is abstract romanticism of your bullshit feelings.
Absolutely despicable! Students at a Nashville school destroy their campus and tear down the American flag.  Sadly, this generation doesn’t comprehend the values of patriotism. Spoiled brats! #NationalStudentWalkout https://t.co/e6DemE9nZ4 < - > @RealKyleMorris @AnaPortman1 Spoiled yes.  Raised to believe their every thought and feeling is right (unable to handle people who disagree with them).  And being taught from First Grade on that America is bad; patriotism is hate; socialism is good.  Sad. They have been utterly corrupted and brainwashed.
Come as you are but leave a different person. If you are the same person going into church, the body of Christ needs to cut them off! If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off https://t.co/QnzSDp95P7 < - > @Jason_Johnson_1 The body of Christ needs to cut them off? That's one thing I can't agree with. Maybe after some time if a person continues in unrepentance and rejects the Lord then yes. I agree that we need judgment but, can you explain the cutting off a little more?
I don't see how any of my edits are contradictions. < - > Your own post on the page is doing the exact opposite of what you have just quoted.

Disagree! It is a confirmation of their colonization. Tribes have no formal agreement with the Pakistan.

No.  You know fetuses can’t scream, right? I transect the cord 1st so there’s really no opportunity, if they’re even far enough along to have a larynx.  I won’t apologize for performing medicine. I’m also a “uterus ripper outer,” if that’s how you’d like to describe hysterectomy. https://t.co/lng0W3ta5J < - > @LeahNTorres Hey Leah.  Appreciate your honesty, even tho I disagree with you on the underlying argument.  Question for you, if you don't mind.  At what point do you consider it a baby vs fetus? And is there a point where you wouldn't perform your medicine outside of cases of mother's health?

The president admitted he lied to trudeau, but julie was saying that as a practice he can be loose with facts - and there is a difference in politics. persuasion often includes puffing https://t.co/DdnYkBF4sM < - > @ChrisCuomo Texas.. No.. “loose with facts” is fine especially with full context.  Unless of course you want to use lying in place of typical political terminology.. spin, misspeak, hyperbole, evolving,etc.  Fact checkers might disagree b/c they created lie level system for our politicians.
We want to remind everyone that we support ‘free speech’ but not when it causes distress. Free speech is based on the victim’s feelings about your speech. #EndTheHate https://t.co/vLqXMtyzoy < - > @CuckexPolice Mermaids is clearly the victim in this situation. Calling the police on people you disagree with and then having them defend themselves against your accusations is clearly harassment and abuse! Your free speech ends where trans feelings begins!!
Um, no. < - > Um, yes.
Some would even dispute the 1931 Statute of Westminster as granting full independence, as jurisdiction over foreign affairs remained ambiguous. < - > There was no ambiguity post-1931. The Statute of Westminster was absolutely clear: No act of the British parliament would have effect in Canada unless the Canadian government gave its consent to such.
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article.

The point is that the manufacturer of the test does not cite any newer information, and the 1994 reference was not peer reviewed, calling it into question. < - > Neuromancer, I'm not sure why you mention the fact that Abbott ''does not cite any newer information.'' If you're suggesting that this makes the Taylor '86 and/or Rutherford '90 more reliable than Buchbinder '94, I would disagree.
Modern Monetary Theory -  There's some truth, that money can be created as debit not credit (origin of 'Greenback' (Lincoln))   BUT Money MUST have a representation function, it represent goods/services – excess money (inflation) is paid for by all https://t.co/HNTA2TSFEd #MMT https://t.co/FgOTmpGG5P < - > @SvOstaayen Respectfully, I vehemently disagree that money "represents" goods. What it represents is a claim against the government. https://t.co/Pc1ZDrXxJ1
These reforms set up a clear code of conduct for all dioceses to follow when faced with an allegation including alerting the authorities, conducting an investigation and removing the accused priest or employee from duty.Cheers!Cheers!I don't think that Wassupwestcoast's rewrite of the abuse scandal section is an improvement. < - > I wouldn't emphasize too much the '' the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse'' because there are still new cases coming forward.
The term 'Centrifugal force' really is used to describe force terms in polar coordinates even in inertial frames; indeed I have added that quite clearly to other articles. < - > That's not correct.
Great meeting @KyleKashuv today - an extraordinary young man with a heart for helping those around him. We had a productive discussion about bipartisan ways we can address school safety and keep kids safe. https://t.co/HoVnUvcIZl < - > @VP @GOP @KyleKashuv Then why no comment about the student walkouts all around the country and even the world.  Everyone except the GOP and NRA agree that this must end.  The students are showing the true strength of Democracy. Too bad you don't care. They will vote soon.
This is a really regressive and disappointing decision that will effectively punish those who do recycle and add to the already huge problem of illegal dumping in the City, not to mention the impact on our ability to reach our waste and carbon emission reduction targets. https://t.co/u7i01K4ZWj < - > @CByrneGreen Don't agree. It's a service to be charged for. We can't use free to incentivise behaviour because then the service has no value.
It seems clear that the current.com url is not an RS, lets start there and see if Aiken has published this somewhere more reliably. < - > current.com is Current TV, so I don't know how you can support that statement.
Einstien was never diagnosed, as far as I know. < - > Two great examples of AS sufferers: Albert Einstein and Isaac Asimov.
The problem with your version is it leaves out mention of persecution of Catholics, and many other factors. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.

If this is indeed the case, then the article titled Waterboarding in the 21st Century is, in its title at any rate, misleadingly anachronistic and, contrary to what some of its advocates seek to avoid (i.e. an 'Anglo-American' bias), succeeds in reinforcing, more insidiously because unacknowledged, precisely that. < - > Rename WB in the 21C whatever you want, just get the recentist stuff about america cut down in this article so this can be the ''article giving the wider view in terms of both history and geography'' that it should be.

I don't have to agree with every single thing my friends say in order to be friends with them, but I also can't sit back and watch somebody else call them names and swear at them. < - > If you're the kind of person who can't disagree with somebody without reacting in that way, we probably shouldn't be friends, because it's going to cause some problems.  I'm not really terribly sorry about this 🤷‍♀️
There is no original research. < - > You have, however, again removed the well-sourced statement that the UN backed down form a previous claim, and replaced it with you original research.

Instead it correctly notes that BP is the well operator, lead the cleanup / containment effort so far, and bore the brunt of the public cry for Obama to do something. < - > There's no reason to mention BP (or any of the involved corporate entities) in this biography at all.
From following the links, it becomes obvious that Obama mis-identified his 4th-grade school as being a Muslim school, when it is a secular school at which he did read the Koran (and make faces while doing so....) One year of taking a class on the Koran at the age of 10 is far different than attending a school dedicated to Islam. < - > Now back to the topic at hand, I don't think Obama ''mispoke'' when he said he attended a Muslim school.

My thought for the day: Britain has been subjected to a terrorist attack by another state and yet there is little sense of a united response. Something has changed in our society and not in a good way. We have become too atomised and patriotic social solidarity is much weakened. < - > @oflynnmep @_HenryBolton I disagree what we have become is aware of FAKE NEWS, PROPAGANDA, by all the major media outlets. We are at the stage where we don't believe anything the government say and as for the Brussels Broadcasting Corporation enough said.
Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager slams Hillary for trashing Middle America:   “This…this was bad.” “I can’t sugarcoat it” “She was wrong" "Not helpful to Democrats” “Unfortunate” “She’s still struggling [with her loss]” “I do wish she would stop” https://t.co/Gi3YWKibVR https://t.co/bnhN29jHgy < - > @RNCResearch I supported Hillary during the 2016 election... But I think it's time to stop bashing the people on either side of the aisle. So what if you disagree with them. I rather wish they hadn't voted Trump into office - but those people are still Americans.
(and where exactly - outside of the Ottoman Empire - were they allegedly deported to?) IMO (based on review of the scholarly/historical analysis) the word/term ''deportation'' is in fact a catch phrase of genocide deniers who attempt to minimize what actually occured - as there was no deportation (but instead what occured was uprooting [mass ethnic cleansing - if you will] of the native population and forced starvation and massacre through direct and indirect means - ie. < - > I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)?

I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement.
You seem to have forgotten Australia, Canada and the other countries. < - > Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.--
the tp is very clear about its desire to reduce spending across the board. challenging the tp support for reducing the size of military and ending subsides is rather laborious. < - > The thing is, the Paul family are outnumbered by TP supporters who don't want to do that.
#CatchingFeelings , which I just saw, is a beautiful film. It's nicely paced, understated, infectious characters, and- unlike some local films- does NOT try too hard. Effortless.  Great performances by everyone especially @PearlThusi @andrewbuckland1 @PunchNCream &amp; @KagisoLediga < - > @Eusebius @PearlThusi @andrewbuckland1 @PunchNCream @KagisoLediga Watched it and I disagree. Its too slow for me and there are various interesting story lines that were very interesting that should have been explored further. I think Kagiso is on the correct path though and cannot wait for his next project.

In a recent study, concrete facts were gathered &amp; from 2000 to 2014 only 4,118 people underwent transgender surgery.  If you’re wondering that’s just 0.0013% of the 320 million people who live in the US today.  Should we alter society for 0.0013% of the population?  Nope. < - > @TyEducatingLibs If U educate yourself on what happens in a "sex change operation", you would disagree that such a thing as a true sex change happened. It's mutilation not a sex change w lots negative consequences like urinary incontinence for one. Impossible to change one's gender/sex.

The point is that the most common viewpoint and the one basic to the view of such texts as Taylor and of Arnol'd and of Landau and Lifshitz and of Whittiker is the one based upon centrifugal forces that vanish in a non-rotating frame, and are present in a rotating frame. < - > Brews, there seems to be something wrong about your remark that: ''The point is that the most common viewpoint and the one basic to the view of such texts as Taylor and of Arnol'd and of Landau and Lifshitz and of Whittiker is the one based upon centrifugal forces that vanish in a non-rotating frame, and are present in a rotating frame.
You said: A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. It means you're talking about a different situation than scoped by this article.- ( < - > No, you misunderstood the question. Again, the question is: What do YOU (Wolfkeeper) mean when you say you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame?
I truly believe that the reason why Bethesda is taking so long developing the elder scrolls is because of the Witcher 3. The game is so close to perfection that they'll probably need 3 or 4 more years before they can get close to what CD PROJEKT RED did. < - > @EonPlug I disagree. I think Bethesda doesnt care about witcher 3. If they did they would make fallout 4 better as they seen the project way before we did. Reason why ES is not coming out is because they are afraid of making one. Because either casual fan base or hardcore one will hate it

There are also little wording issues like The hostile criticisms of the Reformation which insert a subtle POV. < - > I think the present wording of the article is more correct than what you are suggesting.

The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church.

Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY. < - > I disagree that ''Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY.'' While no one, except mostly reality show stars, become famous/notable for their personal lives, I do not believe that it's trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia.

Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose' WP:PARITY does not mention anywhere that a pseudoscience ''journal'' can be used to critize something published in a journal like Nature. What these pseudoscience journals can be used for is to show their views in general but not treated as an equal to a real journal.
I personally think that your edits have been very POV.Please refrain from inserting incorrect and non-factual changes into this article. < - > That would be in your eyes only.
I think we should stick to peer-reviewed journal articles and material published by well-respected scientists at major universities. < - > Might make a suitable external link, however.
A frame of reference is a set of axes which you use to measure positions, positions which may then be expressed in a coordinate system. Coordinate systems are not the same as reference frames, and it's common to measure a position according to multiple coordinate systems on Earth for example. < - > You say ''a frame is a set of axes which you use to measure positions'', and then you go on to say ''positions may then be expressed in a coordinate system''. How exactly do you ''measure positions'' without a coordinate system? A set of axes IS a coordinate system. Hence the name ''coordinate axes''. Look, this has all been explained (as has everything else) previously. A frame is an equivalence class of mutually stationary coordinate systems. And one again, the choice of a coordinate system, or a class of coordinate systems, does not change any physical events. It may change the terms of your description of the events, but it doesn't change the events themselves.

On the ''sex scandal'' front I think the article should read as below to give a better WORLD VIEW and completely fair description...''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse, though the figure is very low the sensationalistic United States media which is generally centered to a WASP audience in particular enjoy blowing it out of proportion to present a negative view of Catholicism. < - > The first part of the first sentence (''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse'') sounds fine.

I believe it is obvious that Bevel has no business appearing alongside Parks and King in this context, and I have reverted Kryn's edit.
Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD. < - > What is most recent is not necessarily what is most notable: new information should be carefully balanced against old, with due weight accorded to each.'' The position Ling.Nut advocates distorts historical perspective; compared with other controversies, the sex abuse scandals are barely notable, and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight.

The argument about authors being able to get ''their objections published in equally respected journals'' has been addressed a few times here and as stated in WP:PARITY ''Parity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia'' This is the case with research into astrology, not because of the quality of the research or the credentials of the researchers but the nature of the subject. < - > The policy you are quoting is in regards to subjects that are not discussed in mainstream journals, and we should not expect to find, e.g., distinctions in and arguments between different schools of ''Creation Science'' in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. This objection does not fit in this case. It is also somewhat ironic that the text of WP:PARITY makes it clear that it was intended to allow for non-peer reviewed criticisms of fringe theories (the cited example is criticisms of moon landing conspiracy theories) into articles covering those fringe theories, and you are applying it in reverse here.

There is NOTHING at WP:CITE that contradicts Template:Cite book regarding accessdate=. There is just less mention of accessdate at WP:CITE.

(Emphasis added.) The ''Web pages'' subsection of ''Examples'', and only that subsection, lists among things typically to be included ''the date you retrieved it (required if the publication date is unknown)''.

Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. That means that these journals are simply not scientific, and should be considered as self-published sources. By pretending that these sources have equal weight with the publication in such a top ranked journal as Nature we simply discredit Wikipedia as whole.-- < - > These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''.

my biggest advice on reading restore me, or any other highly anticipated book that comes out multiple years after the previous one: go into it for the characters, not your own expectations. < - > you can always walk away from "they did something i disagree with," but you can't walk away from "i don't agree that this would happen." read slowly. read carefully. read to enjoy the characters, not with a checklist of what you wanted to happen.
I'm not debating the virtues and vices of capitalism here - I'm saying that the terminology and tone of this article is very clearly derived from the Communist Manifesto. < - > The terminology is prior to Marx. It comes from Turgot, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, etc. Its rather standard, and been used pretty conventionally across the board. The only word that comes from Marx himself is ''Capitalism''. And that's to his credit, since nobody else really identified it as a distinctive system before. It's not about being right or left.

If that were the case, this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general; for if a source is truly trustworthy/authoritative with regards to pseudoscience, then it speaks for scientific community in general. < - > Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves.
The lede currently states: > The term black people is used is a category sometimes used in systems of racial classification about humans perceived to be of a dark skinned phenotype, relative to other racial groups. As a black person, when I read this kind of sentence, I just roll my eyes. I find it extremely condescending and an affront to the intelligence of black people. < - > The reason it is necessary to have a vague word like ''perceived'' is of course because blackness is relative and a person whose skin is classified as white in the Dominican Republic or Brazil may be classified as Black in the US. What counts as ''Darkness'' and what doesn't is at least partly in the eye of the beholder.

You are overcomplicating a simple fact with hoary metaphysics. < - > I never mentioned metaphysic or brought in any metaphysical claim.
As a speaker of Hiberno-English I can assure you the term British Isles is a common term for these islands. < - > Where is your evidence that this term ''British Isles'' is used in Hiberno-English? (minus Ulster English; even then, the Irish nationals who speak Ulster English would be even more inclined never to use the term due to the political situation in the North.) From my experience, I know no one who would use the term to refer to Ireland and Britain. To associate the term British with Ireland is largely unheard of in Ireland. It baffles me that you use it. How about you give ME evidence to prove otherwise?

(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV. < - > Better than mentioning both of them, in my opinion, would be mentioning neither, since the impact of religious belief (or lack thereof) on political activity is difficult to substantiate, and intrinsically controversial.
All the meanings, usages, and points of view are so closely interconnected and overlap so much that it's quite inefficient to try to discuss them all separately. < - > The page we have for that is the disambiguation page. I personally don't think that the different forces that you have there, some that are real forces that oppose centripetal force, some that are fictitious forces that are reference frame related, and some that are coordinate related are the same things at all.

Virtually all criticism aimed at Obama is foot-stamping hyperbole by political opponents.

There has been criticism of Obama by liberals.

Capitalist mode of production pretty much captures it, but of course that's not going to work here, as truth/facts are famously not the decisive criteria in this site. < - > Capitalist mode of production may describe it from a marxist perspective, and may therefore be useful in marxist contexts, but that description is consequently either misleading or inaccurate when applied to the real world and to evidence-based economics.
There are TP supporters who want to close Guantanamo Bay and overseas bases.

The Biafran army made several early strategic victories and smaller armies have won against better drilled and resourced armies .   But the latter is 100% a correct. Ojukwu is not an a man without fault. He fled.

The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > Harris seems to have very little in the way of background to be granted the presumption of an informed opinion either way, he is a neuroscientist with a BA in Philosophy who seems to not know or appreciate that theism is a back-formation from atheism. Seriously. I think it is fine that he holds that view, but I think that the placement in that section is in error.
That's an odd comparison, and totally not true for me AT ALL. < - > no way, prof layton has puzzles and stuff
How exactly do you ''measure positions'' without a coordinate system? A set of axes IS a coordinate system. Hence the name ''coordinate axes''. Look, this has all been explained (as has everything else) previously. < - > No. Do you have a good reference saying that a frame of reference is exactly the same thing as a coordinate system? Because they're self evidently not the same. A frame of reference has an origin and a way of determining direction. A coordinate system is applied relative to that. A frame of reference can be a physical thing, or a mechanical construct. A coordinate system is not a mechanical construct. They are not the same.- (

Nope.

Voice of the Faithful does not buy the argument that ''clamour created in the US around this scandal is really unbearable'' as Cardinal Bertone said. < - > I disagree with both of your perceptions.
Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability. < - > I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia.
For these reasons, I feel that his response to the spill deserves mention.--The section on the oil spill is way too long. < - > This is a biography cover his entire life. Giving details of every incident during his presidency is impossible.

So we don't trust our own security services and should send a sample of the poison to Russia because we know we can trust theirs. Have I got this right, Corbyn disciples? < - > @mrjamesob I thought you were in favour of a rules-based international system?

Not for, like, the 13th pick.

It never ceases to amaze me that those who reject God, reject His Word, will borrow from the Christian world view based in the Bible for pronouncements about morality--they are so blind, so inconsistent, so hypocritical--&amp; they refuse to see this cause in their heart they know! < - > @aigkenham Very few people, Christian or otherwise would disagree with "though shalt not kill" the bit they take issue with is the many "save for when" clauses that follow. Just because the Bible got it right about murder doesn't mean it is right on homosexuality or other issues.

If the #Raiders finalize a deal with WR Jordy Nelson, they are likely to release WR Michael Crabtree, who has a $7.7M cap hit. That is in their plans. < - > @RapSheet I disagree with moving on from Crab (cut Roberts instead) but I would love the Jordy signing. Down year 2017, sure, when HUNDLEY was his QB. Before that, outside his injury in 2015 he's been an absolute stud. Great locker room presence, and will help Amari evolve. #RaiderNation
If we go for #5 then we'll move the three non-summary sections (''Theoretical concepts'', ''Characterizations'', ''Marketing'') to the TMT article. < - > These sections however equally apply to both the TMT and the TMM.

Excuse us, but you referred to the purported ''Gini category'' as a ''fact''. < - > Surely you are aware that this is just tertile being expressed in more user-friendly way (colours and words 'high','medium','low').
1. Caroline Lucas is one of the leading architects of the narrative that there is a far right surge in the UK.

The people protesting are literally the future of the country, and we'll shape how our adulthoods will be and how our kids futures will look. Take action and stop the vicious cycle we're in.
To be honest, I think the main reason we've been unable to consolidate the entire subject of centrifugal force (within mechanics), or even just the inertial/fictitious force part of the subject, into a single article is that some editors feel very strongly (just as did the guy back in 1898) that there is only ONE ''correct'' usage and interpretation of the term, and they don't want to sully their article with any hint or suggestion that there might be any other permissible usages within mechanics. < - > The different pages present different aspects of the term ''centrifugal force'', not different interpretations or points of view.

This is an important insight. I sometimes read papers that say things about practitioners (often managers) that it's hard to imagine the implicated persons identifying with. That doesn't make it wrong. But it should affect how you write. 1/3 https://t.co/O8nR3nzdEa < - > Of course, the same goes for the reaction of theorists, i.e., your peers.

A frame of reference has an origin and a way of determining direction. A coordinate system is applied relative to that. A frame of reference can be a physical thing, or a mechanical construct. A coordinate system is not a mechanical construct. They are not the same.- ( < - > As I said in the message to which you are responding, a frame is NOT a coordinate system, it is an equivalence class of mutually stationary coordinate systems. (Do you understand what this means?) But YOU gave your own definition, i.e., you said ''a frame is a set of axes which you use to measure positions'', to which I responded that a set of axes used to measure positions is a coordinate system, and hence your subsequent comments were non-sequiturs.

Let me clear up what I meant above, I certainly don't mean that we should exclude RS material just because it was written by atheists, not at all - what I meant to address was the notion that just because someone calls themselves atheist that they somehow have the ability to redefine what it means. < - > ''Redefine'' is question begging.
I do agree we neeed some photos but the use of photos of the tank and statue of Lenin are propaganda photos to try to associate PMR with communism. < - > That is not a photo of the Lenin statue, it's a photo of the Transnistrian parliament, which happens to have a statue of Lenin in front of it.

Yes. Traitor, sexist, racist... the same tired labels. Also interesting is the generalized statements coming from a group of people who hate generalizations. They are so blinded by denial they can’t see their own mental illness. https://t.co/GdhxsqhUHd < - > @Ceparski That's deep. I see the issue as trying to connect and communicate with people individually. If we disagree, we just don't interact. Name calling seems silly at my age. Not a fan of generalizations either. We're all "mentally ill." Some have just learned better coping mechanisms.
This implies the mindset that it's some external force influencing them, that they need to just pray against it or something. < - > Well, it's not as simple as ''pray against it''.
In my opinion, both the present and proposed texts are unsatisfactory, because they pay undue attention to this pre-WWII event. < - > I believe both the Spanish Civil War and the bombing of Guernica must be borne in mind to understand causes and roots of WW2.
Political math explains everything. The NDP sees the possibility of taking 5-7 seats from the Liberals in BC with no possible gains in AB. https://t.co/ELsfm43CMW < - > @tleehumphrey The government has the power to legislate this pipeline but will not do it as they are putting themselves ahead of the country.....Even though I disagree with NDP  leader Singh at least he has stated his position

I appreciate the words of support- even from those who normally dislike me. Free speech is a gift- no need to resort to that kind of attack. I’ll discuss the restaurant incident on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning. < - > @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Exactly, and that I'd why NFL players should be allowed to kneel. That is their free speech. Just like you have the right to free speech. I disagree with your politics but I will defend your right to free speech just like I will defend the NFL players right to kneel.
The program should be continued and further empowered.  Also Parlimen Belia should have more teeth, recognition &amp; allocation.  I’ll raise this matter when i meet up with Prime Minister and the newly soon to be appointed Minister of Youth &amp; Sports (if there is one) https://t.co/DJRqw71SgF < - > @SyedSaddiq Strongly disagree. @PerdanaFellows is counterproductive towards having youth with independant thought. The right term should be “study its effectiveness” instead of “further empowering”. We don’t need more minions, we need more central negatives.

Personally I'd vote to have it back for such crimes.
Trump, on NFL, suggests players who kneel 'shouldn't be in the country' https://t.co/ao4CMTND8W < - > @politico “First they came for the rich black Football players but I did not speak out because I was not a rich black football player”  The National Anthem is a song. In America no one is required to like it, sing it or assume a particular pose while it’s played. Period.  Disagree? Screw!

Trivial matters require little to no research. It’s easy to focus your anger on a joke told by a comic, but it’s a lot harder to do the research to really understand the intricacies of a societal crisis. That’s why there’s more anger at Michelle Wolf than Sanders herself today. https://t.co/Q2pr2WdNih < - > @SethMacFarlane The problem is that the comic believes the joke to be based in reality and laughing at that supposed fact.  Since the people disagree with the premise of the facts the joke is based on the joke seems more like an purposefully offensive insult than something to make you laugh
"The 'smell of old books' is the smell of rot. It’s gross. Don't @ me."   Agree? Disagree? https://t.co/RAK9P6JMKg < - > @littlebrown Disagree. To me it smells like paper. Old paper. No it's not the smell of a fresh pot of coffee but it makes me feel comforted just the same.
Trump: Those Who Won’t Stand For National Anthem “Shouldn’t be in the Country” https://t.co/YTLxnD9fle < - > @PrisonPlanet Disagree. I have always stood. I do it as a show of respect to the old veterans. For spurts of 8 years at a time, I had considered not standing. That right should be protected.
The ignorance in this thread is astonishing. But not surprising https://t.co/zXpQZ1euhu < - > @jmmireles93 I know people will disagree or whatever, but I see a world that’s too busy dividing itself - screw your politics, the world shouldn’t be like this. The world should be as one, people should be able to live where they want.
55-year old Jerry Rice looks in better shape than Richard Sherman, and that’s not a knock on Sherman. At all. < - > @LombardiHimself Respectfully.... disagree.  : )
Racism is just humour. https://t.co/OHYv0Bo9I2 < - > @tradasro Disagree - as would victims of real discrimination. However, this is just a person trying to be funny and failing. I can take a joke, and Scotland should look forward to being a self confident nation, not looking for any chance for victimhood and fake moral outrage.
Students at Parkland are threatening to boycott their graduation if Kyle Kashuv is the valedictorian.  What do they mean "if" he's valedictorian? It's not a popularity contest, it’s the person with the highest grades. Period.  If they want to miss their own graduation, let them. < - > @Education4Libs @newstouse Enjoy missing your graduation. If the student earned it, you can't deny that person simply because you don't like the person or disagree with the student.
Trump: NFL players who don't stand for anthem 'maybe shouldn't be in the country' https://t.co/2e9S65O6pD https://t.co/yf2Nk1qTfG < - > @KDVR I disagree. NFL players (and everyone else) who don't stand for our anthem DEFINITELY shouldn't be in our country.  No "maybe" about it. Other countries don't have a lot of tolerance for people who hate their own country, unless you're France.  Or Germany, or Sweden, or...
Rapid fire from Sen. @MarcoRubio explaining the danger of giving in to China on ZTE.  Every American regardless of political beliefs or party affiliation should watch this speech.  This is our last chance to stop China from overtaking the US.  Full speech https://t.co/l1QThDqiei https://t.co/pYIYzrJgfz < - > @ReaganBattalion @marcorubio There are many things on which Rubio and I disagree (not this issue). Regardless, this video is an example of the kind of president we could have had, one who could have made the GOP, and maybe the country, proud, instead of a president hell-bent on destroying both.

COLUMN | The NFL threw money at its anthem problem, but its new policy will still lead to more contempt from players: https://t.co/rnHBZzYe06 < - > @TerezPaylor I disagree.   The NFL is not saying they have to stand.   The NFL is just not allowing them to kneel.   They would be within their rights to require the players to stand, but they didn’t force that.   The players can stay in the locker room.   Their absence can be their protest.

Yes, Trump is just doing this to stir up a culture war that is very appealing to his base.

It's true that trust in US media has collapsed. Also true they have done a lot to cause this &amp; engage in almost no self-critique &amp; thus can't fix it. But the absolute last thing anyone needs is a billionaire angry about negative reporting, spitefully using his wealth in vengeance https://t.co/0pisR1q0S7 < - > @ggreenwald I disagree. It's about time someone kept you guys (journalists/media) in check. Any efforts to promote this kind of review website by a grass roots movement would be crushed by another angry billionaire looking to protect his media interests. Elon has clout and resources
Hey you guys! ❤️ I wrote an op-ed for "The Guardian".  I managed to shoehorn the word "shambolic" into the piece, but I don't think they wouldn't have let me use the word "choad". 😂 (No, he hasn't unblocked me yet.) #ThursdayThoughts  https://t.co/ejusUaGbqG < - > @AynRandPaulRyan Preach, sista. “Twitter is as public a forum as a town hall meeting. By blocking people who disagree with him, he’s not only blocking our right to petition our government and access important information, but he distorts that public forum by purging critical voices.”
Also, very few of you tweeting me w a hypothetical occurrence @ their workplace actually have to stand for the anthem to start the day. I’m also aware (no lawyer here so who knows) that it’s technically the league’s right. I just disagree w it + think it may get messier bc of it. < - > @JOEL9ONE If you disagree with it you can always find another job where you don't need to stand up for the National Anthem or even listen to it.
"You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing. ... Maybe you shouldn't be in the country."  Donald Trump is maintaining his  hard stance on NFL national anthem protests. https://t.co/VpBJGS5EB0 https://t.co/I0CkFad7dq < - > @NESN “First they came for the rich black Football players but I did not speak out because I was not a rich black football player”  National Anthem is a song. In America no one is required to like it, sing it or assume a particular pose while it’s played. Period.  Disagree? Screw you!
The last word on the argument that Israel is alienating American Jews, by @rosnersdomain https://t.co/Nx2EaasOP9 < - > @jpodhoretz @rosnersdomain No chance that American Jews simply fear anti Semitism no matter the political rationale?  “It is worth noting that complaints about evangelical anti-Semitism ... always comes from the quarters that also happen to disagree with evangelical politics.”
The Celtics, led by a rookie and missing their biggest stars, have all the makings of a classic sports underdog story. So why does the prospect of them in the Finals feel so deflating? @rodger_sherman: https://t.co/yk9hPsa4Lv < - > @ringer @rodger_sherman Disagree with the premise of this article. Celts have won one title in the past 31 seasons. They've had horrible luck (Bias, Lewis deaths, losing Tim Duncan draft lottery, the 2010 Finals loss). Winning a title this year would actually offset some of their misfortune (1)

I was initially outraged by Trump's statement about people who don't stand for the anthem getting out of the country.  Then I remembered a lot of people just shrugged when the governor of the state I've lived in my whole life said I don't belong here.  https://t.co/oVTcAxquMT https://t.co/Fc4AQ0Jzbv < - > I'm willing to stand and fight on principle but if people who don't agree with me don't really think it's a principle that applies to both of us equally, it's not a principle.

The root of this decision today by the NFL was to cave to political pressure from The White House.   In essence, the NFL is masking their hyper-political decision as a decision to take politics out of the game.   This is all politics...and whiteness. https://t.co/CZ08QzlASV < - > @ShaunKing You’ve established your narrative and continue to push it because that is who you have become on social media.

No no no no no. The NFL giving athletes the "option" to wait in the locker room during the anthem if they don’t want to stand for it is a cowardly and shameful alternative. It’s a gross misunderstanding of the rights of players and it’s disrespectful to the issues (1/2) < - > @missmayim Believe it or not, but when we are representing a brand we no longer have The First Amendment. I think our Founding Fathers would disagree with it, but right now it is what it is.  If a business thinks you're going t hurt them financially then there is no reason for them to
Whatever your view on abortion, the attempt to link it to the EU is profoundly dishonest. Doing so while shrieking about Soros is deranged. https://t.co/D0SIeDzEMh < - > @StevePeers Have to disagree with Steve for a 1st time. It’s not deranged - it’s coldly calculated. Far right &amp; anti semites have consistently linked Soros, human rights with death of “white Christians” nations.  It’s a common old anti Jewish trope. That’s why the EU is roped into the trope.
Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men &amp; Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE < - > @realDonaldTrump You have inflicted great pain against anyone who disagree with you!!!! You suck up to Putin and Kim but turn our allies against the United States!! You have used the bully pulpit to rain Dow on our own Intel agents, Justice Dept and house and Senate Democrats!?!!
'बी' का या 'सी' का कोई अधिकार नहीं कि वे ज्ञान दें कि 'हिंदू, हिंदुत्व' क्या हैं। 'सी' हिंदू विरोधी थी ही, इसलिए हिंदुओं ने 'बी' पर भरोसा किया, हिंदू माँगें पूरी करने के वादें किएँ बी ने और जीतने के बाद हिंदुओं को गुंडा कहा,जेल भेजा,कोक कैन जैसा फेंक दिया। राजनेताओं, अब बस https://t.co/ExLEa4Xhpr < - > @DrPravinTogadia Pravinji I totally disagree with Modiji's statement that Hinduism is a way of life.

Reached episode 41 in my HxH 99 rewatch last night. One of my all-time favs. It blows its 2011 counterpart out of the water.

I can't watch! #NFLVote < - > @SylviaKAlston @Ravens Understand your stance.  Don't agree. If the platform is destroyed then the message is muted.

This is a good point. By the judge's logic banning anyone from twitter violates their right to read trump's tweets while having a twitter account.

Green says every member of the house has the right and privilege to bring up impeachment.  "There’s a good likelihood there will be articles of impeachment” brought against Trump, Rep.

I do not understand how a multi-billion dollar company can utterly botch such a relatively simple "problem" as the whole anthem thing. Seriously. This wouldn't be a story any more if they'd just said "we don't like it, but it's their right" and stopped televising the anthem. < - > @RealMNchiefsfan Respect your opinion and your heart, as always, Seth. But I disagree. If you do not wish to stand for the anthem, players can stay in the locker room. But if you are going to be on the field, you WILL stand. Options for both. Don't see what the big deal is.

This is how Trump stokes racial tensions in America.

I think it’s dumb that we play the national anthem before sporting events at all.  It makes sense if it’s a match between two international teams (Olympics, World Cup, etc.), but doing it before literally every game is weird and arbitrary. < - > @ParkerMolloy Hard disagree. I think we should be playing the national anthem before everything. Literally everything. Getting into a cab? Nation anthem. Sitting down for dinner? National anthem.
