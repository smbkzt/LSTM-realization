When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > (in an introduction or elswhere in the article) Again - I ask you to please provide evidence of the thriving Armenian colony where Ottoman Armenians were ''deported'' to by the CUP.
''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide? < - > This discussion about the use of the word ''deportations'' is over as far as I am concerned.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > You are suggesting making changes to the introduction of the article to correct semantic and not actually substantive errors.
The word ''deportations'' has been used since 1915 in relation to the Armenian genocide; one of the best known document's produced to illustrate the genocide's effects is the map titled ''The Routes of Deportations'' first published back in 1920. < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > On the contrary, I will always make suggestions for important changes to the article here in the talk page first, and will always engage with those wishing to make a positive contribution and will try to incorporate the reasonable views of others in any proposals I make.
I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians. < - > However, the talk page is not a forum to discuss the Armenian genocide or a forum to confront genocide denialists and their propaganda, it is actually a place to discuss the improvement of the Wikipedia entry on the Armenian Genocide.
So while I appreciate (and agree with) the points you are trying to make - lets not fall into the trap of accepting (essentially) denialist (and false) terminology.-- < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
It seems obvious to me - considering the scholarly analysis and the known historical record - that no Armenians were actually deported anywhere. < - > You, on the other hand, just seem to use this talk page as a platform on which to display your ego as you bash about the head visiting genocide denialists.
Some scholars (and Turkish apologists) point to some of the first ''deportations'' being from Eastern Anatolia to Konya (though most never made it that far and even those who did were qucikly re-uprooted and sent South into the desert...) - where the aim of the CUP apeared to be only lessening of the concentration of Armenians in what had been (in years prior) predominantly Armenian Areas (which were still very culturally Armenian). < - > So if we are attempting to change the introduction to improve accuracy - particularly in regards to semantics - then I would suggest we do it right.
I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)? < - > I agree that the term used be ''forced (death) marches'', for infact that is exactly what was used by the Ottoman Empire.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > Anyway I am all in favor of your contributing to the article itself in the manner you have proposed and I will certainly comment on particulars that I am either in favor of or oppose though I have no desire to be dictatorial in any way.
An answer as succinct and powerful as the one given by Lewis in the video above should certainly be quoted in this article. < - > It's all off-topic for this talk page.
(I really hope that's your goal... < - > You need to be much more wary.
I'd love a real response, i.e. < - > I almost forgot: you must recognize that a separate page for ''denial of the genocide'' is by no means sufficient.
You're really sticking your head in a hole with this one. < - > It's all off-topic for this talk page.
And, btw, I do know that in Britain recently a woman was actually convicted of a terrorist offense just for creating a work of fiction. < - > Let me help you a bit.
Of course that doesn't change the fact that Article 301 is a shame, but saying that it's illegal is a misinformation. < - > Still, I don't think it would be a different case if Armenians were in their shoes, they don't mind turning to brute force themselves.--
The manual of style dictates how articles are named, it being roughly ''The name by which something is most widely known in English, by which English-speakers are most likely to recognise it and refer to it''. < - > A very small minority dissent from this position, and if that dissent came from anywhere other than Turkey's government, we'd probably give it even less weight.
As the borg would say: ''resistance is futile'' < - > Germany did not come to terms with its genocide because they wanted to, they were forced to do so after being defeated.
It is a page to present views from both sides and a page to present a neutral view of events. < - > Just take a look at those that contribute most to this article, mainly Armenians, Greeks or brainwashed sympathizers.
you hide other point of views. < - > ''The name by which something is most widely known in English'' case would be true if the article had a neutral point of view, but the article is from the point of view of the claimists.
The majority of historians agree it was a genocide. < - > Until you (dance with the devil and nasmos)are taken out of your dream and into a reality, then this article will always be a biased and non-wikipedia class article.--
But this article should be perhaps changed to 'Armenian Genocide Theory' or 'Armenian Genocide Claims' in order to neutralize the article. < - > Even the Japanese think that getting nuked was probably the best solution.
Ideas? < - > Oh, and what ''claim'' did I make that requires a reference?
If you think you have that then WP:BEBOLD and just add your information, along with the reference that backs it up. < - > It is absolutely true that Asperger's sufferers are, in general, crippled in social and mental areas compared to the rest of the population, and that is highly relevant to the original discussion because it means that the idea that many more Asperger's sufferers are ''savants'' than the general population is completely false.
So yes you will need to find a source that meets WP:MEDRS for that. < - > If exposure to viewpoints that challenge your preconceived beliefs bothers you, I suggest you remove yourself from this discussion.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). < - > If not, then someone will probably revert it - and we'll discuss the matter here.
If you prefer, it would probably be better to discuss controversial edits here before you add to the article - but that's not required. < - > I've removed some insensitive comments, the result of which were to offend some editors here and to distract the talk page from discussing the content of the article.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). < - > Please remember this is not a forum to discuss AS or people with AS in either positive or negative ways.

If you want, if consensus is there, I can do that, after reinstating the other stuff, it is not that hard to do. < - > As I have explained above, the removals were unwarranted because they did not constitute a general discussion of Asperger's syndrome.

The course should have been for you to ask that I delete them or notify me of it before deleting them.-- < - > I was enunciating that Asperger's sufferers are, in general, crippled in social and mental areas compared to the general population in response to the assertion that the supposedly widespread phenomenon of ''savants'' exists within the ranks of Asperger's sufferers, which is of course false.
These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''. < - > On WP it doesn't matter how logical we, as editors, think an argument is, what matters is how logical or important the correct sources say it is.
If I am permitted to do that, I can prove statistically that goobles wurble whenever one cages a sage in the flowering season, and do so with a significance of better than 0.0001. < - > The first sentence (''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.'') is quite sufficient, otherwise we have a ridiculous and unacceptable situation when the mainstream views (Carlson) are being discussed in lesser details than the fringe sources that criticise them.
Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. < - > It is also somewhat ironic that the text of WP:PARITY makes it clear that it was intended to allow for non-peer reviewed criticisms of fringe theories (the cited example is criticisms of moon landing conspiracy theories) into articles covering those fringe theories, and you are applying it in reverse here.
That means that these journals are simply not scientific, and should be considered as self-published sources. < - > Peer review of meaningless rubbish however, is a far trickier thing.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > I have no problem with reading comprehension.
Please do not change my signature, play with your own. < - > You are right in the sense that ''Astrologers disagree'' with Carlson's conclusions - though that statement invites the comment - they would, wouldn't they?
It looks like I got here too late, the page has already been unlocked. < - > Just follow these simple steps...
Try as they might, astrologers are unable to systematize their claims and evidence, and every single astrological hypothesis that has been scrutinized has been duly rejected and falsified enough to make all claims of scientific validity a pathological science. < - > Yet, most new editors invited in from outside are expected to understand the detail and the nuances from a snapshot.
This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Any mention of the opinion of these journals to criticize Nature would be a serious NPOV violation, specifically DUE, as well as an RS problem. < - > Easy as pie.
At any rate, that is what my peers say. < - > Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis Perform an experiment and collect data, testing the hypothesis Analyze the data Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis Publish results (in actual peer-reviewed journals) Retest and refine (frequently done by other scientists) We call this science and it is the only method humans have for accurately predicing the future.
Alternatively, we can refer only to the opinion of Eysenck, who is notable enough to be explicitly mentioned. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > It can be seen that many RFC contributors have failed to realise that the reference to the Carlson criticism is not a vindication of astrology, merely an indication that this study, like the Gauquelin study, has been blighted by significant controversy.
I concur with others that there might be some problems with the phrasing of the RfC above. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Fringe journals publish what can't be published elsewhere because it wouldn't meet real scientific scrutiny. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
Oppose To using this phrasing or another, per the reasons I have given previously. < - > I will not support this RFC - this has nothing to do with ''honoring community consensus''.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > I think the old encyclopedias were better and I've heard others say it too.
Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. < - > Making a blanket statement that you will not honor the community consensus, regardless of what it is, is probably not going to be helpful to you or your position, and throws up a major red flag in terms of your ability to engage in wikipedia productively.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > Good editors have contributed to this RFC discussion in good faith, but not having been exposed to the full arguments and the consequences of them.
If you follow the threads you will see that in this instance, two of the psychology professors Eysenck and Ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write ''Scientists disagree...'' or ''Psychologists disagree ...''. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
If it's not then it's not big deal, but if it is and it's not posted then it doesn't give the review admin all the information s/he may need. < - > Oppose The edit conflict seems to be between a small group, who are trying to give fringe sources parity with reliable ones, and a larger group determined to maintain the distinction between the two.
Thank you. < - > This is a very inappropriate remark.
Some editors at Astrology are intent on adding the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature into the article (see here for full context: [[5]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Modern astrology is bunk so say the experts who are in the know.
Oppose inclusion per WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE. < - > This is not to reflect poorly on you as an editor, but rather it allows the reviewing admin to take into account what might be relevant to your contribution.
There are a number of reliable secondary sources that could be used instead. < - > Based on the results of this RFC, I suggest we ask for unprotection since there is a clear consensus to remove.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > The correct question, therefore, is ''should we add it?''
And I could get peers to review it too. < - > Oppose.
IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
The policy you are quoting is in regards to subjects that are not discussed in mainstream journals, and we should not expect to find, e.g., distinctions in and arguments between different schools of ''Creation Science'' in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. < - > IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it.
The rest of your argument is not relevant for this reason. < - > This is a distinction that seems to be hard for some folks to grasp but it's one that really needs grasping as all these attempts to use fringe sources in this way are simply beating a dead horse and ignoring policy.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > Whilever well known controversies like this receive no acknowledgement or mention in sources such as WP, adherents will feel vindicated in their belief that there is more to astrology than the scientific establishment is prepared to accept.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
Unless a convincing argument is presented otherwise, keep the Carlson paper, and ditch the fringe criticisms. < - > That's a misrepresentation of what I have said.
What phenomenon is this article about, anyway: academic conceptions of atheism, or atheism as actually practiced? < - > If you wish to argue that EB does not reflect the consensus position then I would have to say that you are making an extraordinary claim that you need to make a case for.
Thomas Huxley, for instance, was unhappy with ''atheism'' because it was too dogmatic; it made a definitive metaphysical claim about the nonexistence of God, for which Huxley believed there was insufficient evidence. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed. < - > ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘Read Eller again, he is in fact saying that it is positive denial and that negative denial in fact reduces to positive denial.
In Michael Martin. < - > None whatsoever.
There are lots of counterexamples, and the text of the current article cites some of them. < - > You have also failed to establish that the EB article represents a ''consensus'' view as opposed to the particular conceptualisation of one particular writer.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > There is indeed a usage that interprets atheism as an index of certainty or dogmatism, an interpretation that is challenged by the work of many atheists who do not claim certainty.
I should also note that ''rejects'' is increasingly, it seems, becoming a term of art where the usage in scholarly works on philosophy is not the same as the lay reading allows - certainly if the lay reading entertains the notion that it is not expressing a certainty about a proposition. < - > The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed.
The distiniction is small but important. < - > That said, I think that we should probably include mention of the tendency to desire a redefinition of atheism that seems to make it overlap that of agnosticism.
Rather, they would hold that an atheist is a person without a belief in God. < - > Further on Gordon Stein and An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism see Martins review here where he notes ( emphasis mine ) ''The section on the meaning of atheism is also of particular interest, primarily for showing that in the past many atheists have not meant by atheism what is meant by that term today.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > I agree that there is diversity of opinion demonstrated in RS, but we should absolutely give primacy to the consensus position, and such a position does indeed exist as is made clear by EB and the majority of dictionaries and encyclopaedias.
This led those who were unable to subscribe to orthodox theism to coin new terms of self-definition, which would allow them to remain uncontaminatcd by the stigma of atheism. < - > 1) Which source do you believe adequately counters the claim that the modern consensus is ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.''?
2) Maybe I'm confused about the ''matter at hand''. < - > Obviously, Unomi, it does matter how atheists have defined atheism.
This is of course later eviscerated by Drange - to which there seems to have been little answer, but loads of IDHT. < - > You can't maintain that atheism is consensually ''a positive denial'' when Eller, for one, says it isn't a positive denial.
Well into the nineteenth century, the negative connotations of the word - as a term of abuse - persisted and came increasingly to be associated with immorality and lawlessness, two of the great fears of the nineteenth-century mind. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
To be without a belief in God merely means that yhe term ''god'' has no importance, or possibly no meaning, to you. < - > There is no consensus, contemporary or otherwise, that atheism requires certainty.
But I suspect that other editors may object. < - > On reflection, I would strongly favour the removal of all but the first paragraph from the introduction; the content in those paragraphs belongs in the main body of the article.
We are defining an -ism, so why would the reader not see the definition and its analogues as a refusal to accept a belief as their own? < - > If you tell me that ''my dog eats garbage'' could actually be understood to mean ''some dogs drink brandy'' I'm going to tell you that's not possible.
What I don't understand Peter, is how you missed the one meaning that the clause has to 99% of readers, and is meant to have. < - > It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for.
Griswaldo and Modocc, have you considered that some people have an interest in how the definitions are used because of how they identify themselves rather than it being a mere pushing against others who identify themselves differently? < - > It seems to me that we are discussing two entirely different things here, and I have low enthusiasm for the two of them, taken together.
So how does one get from this explicit rejection of belief in their existence to ''but not necessarily their existence?'' One simply doesn't because it isn't semantically viable. < - > Cheers.
This will continue until the rhetorical fad that is currently ongoing dies down. < - > Indeed!
As for the possible ambiguities, there is nothing ambiguous about not accepting a religion because you don't accept everything they espouse hook, line and sinker. < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
Tryptofish, I'm not gonna argue or bicker about the introduction too much right now because I think the main game in Wikipedia's coverage is actually on the atheism sub-pages, where some sort of covert war is being fought to legitimise conspiracy theories about atheism, opposition to atheism, and the existence of shadowy 'movements'. < - > Please be advised that a sentence that begins ''This article explains a range of .
It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
The trouble with ''Atheism is the position that deities do not exist'' is that although the position that deities do not exist is atheism, so is the position that a belief that deities exist cannot be justified. < - > I would have low enthusiasm for a lead sentence that talks about the subject being ''difficult to define''.
Ergo, it seems to me that the opening is ambiguous and could benefit from a clearer exposition if one can be found. < - > No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists.
Oh I wish. < - > I'm receptive to a short-and-sweet first sentence, so long as the lead section, as a whole, goes on to cover the three definitions of long standing.
Does this treatment of ambiguity cover your concerns, IP editor? < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
(again, after edit conflicts):That suggestion is simply a restatement of the article's third sentence, or third definition and it is contrary to the Britannica's definition, the source that is cited. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
Well, the positive atheism stuff is probably okay to be restored as well, but I'm a little uncomfortable with the sourcing in that section. < - > I completely forgot about this – thanks for jogging my memory!
I'll reinstate the passage we are agreed on. < - > I'm not sure what the questions about sourcing were.
Unlike agnosticism, which leaves open the question of whether there is a God, atheism is a positive denial. < - > Nielsen is *arguing* for a particular conceptualisation of atheism, not merely reporting an existing consensus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/atheism?show=0&t=1323944845. < - > In the early to mid-19th century, many atheists were proto-noncognitivists in their stated positions.
They are not at odds, and EB states the exact same delineation between agnosticism and atheism, the problem is that you are misreading ''rejects'' - and failing to account for noncognitivism which is the basis for preferring rejects over ''false'' - but they ( as Nielsen makes clear in contrasting agnosticism and atheism ) reduce to the same thing by different routes. < - > I'm saying that you are interpreting ''positive denial'' to a) mean something it need not mean, and b) a a consensus posiiton which it is not actually claimed to be in the text.
It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems. < - > Well, I've read the sources.
It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems. < - > I would urge you to point to specific sources that support your position, at this point I have no way of knowing to what degree you are presenting the sources as intended, or the quality of the sources to begin with.

Atheism used to mean something completely different to what it means today, so it is clear its meaning evolves over time. < - > That makes his inclusion inappopropriate in a discussion of the etymology of the word.

Setting aside what anyone thinks about Harris, I find the quote useful here (and rather innocuous), in that it simply documents one point of view within atheism, about what atheism does or does not mean. < - > In fact, there is considerable discussion of how the word has historically been used as an insult.
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > And at the risk of saying something that really ought to go without saying, Scjessey was absolutely correct to revert Unomi's deletion of the quote.
Harris seems to have very little in the way of background to be granted the presumption of an informed opinion either way, he is a neuroscientist with a BA in Philosophy who seems to not know or appreciate that theism is a back-formation from atheism. < - > While Harris may well be correct, the fact is that the word does exist, and has been used with various meanings (many poorly defined).
That is a special meaning of ''valid'' which is not how it is generally understood in much of Western culture & it is not explained. < - > Also, it is disputed that atheism IS a ''form of belief''.
The word ''valid'' is certainly in the source, but who can unpack what it means there? < - > This could be changed to Moreover, atheism also figures in certain religious and spiritual belief systems, such as Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Neopagan movements[13] such as Wicca.[14] Jainism and some forms of Buddhism and Hinduism do not advocate belief in gods.[15] The lede is an introduction -- the details can go in the body--
The idea that religion is dangerous is one often associated with atheism, as the section explains. < - > Better than mentioning both of them, in my opinion, would be mentioning neither, since the impact of religious belief (or lack thereof) on political activity is difficult to substantiate, and intrinsically controversial.
Philosophical discussions will often lack (or include bias-selected) empirical data -- I could cite examples within this very article -- but that doesn't make them ''unreliable'' or unworthy of inclusion. < - > Although I'm not in agreement, I can see why some might not think the actions of some atheists and atheistic regimes constitute a specific danger of that worldview.
It could use a rewrite though to focus more on atheism and less on atheists. < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
Zacharias indeed states ''Those who, in the name of Christ, have sought to kill in order to propagate their belief were acting in serious contradiction to...the gospel'', but atheism, as propounded by Sartre and Nietzsche, directly ''injunct[ed]...the demagogues...of the Third Reich'' —The real face of atheism, page 65. < - > Prominent atheists like Harris, Russel etc are perfectly suitable for the subject matter of this article.
@JJL - I think your suggested titles are better than any suggested so far (including what I had in mind). < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
Then I was going to expand on the last sentence of the article and report on the view of Dinesh D'Souza (who is mentioned in the Criticism of atheism page) and others that an atheistic worldview was/is the underpinning of brutal, totalitarian regimes like Soviet Russia. < - > Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism.

You are correct that he utilized aspects of Christian philosophy in his public speeches an policies, but I suspect that he was being pragmatic rather than dogmatic. < - > I will also acknowledge that, although I've heard Muslims and others criticize atheism, I am not as familiar with specific sources of that criticism as I am Christian sources (and I don't know of any polytheists' criticism of atheism, although I wouldn't doubt it exists); if others here would like to direct me to such sources for the sake of presenting a wider criticism of atheism, I will look into them and try to incorporate them (although I'm trying to keep the section brief, and those broader arguments may be better made within the Criticism of Atheism article).
because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., “God” is just another name for love, or ... < - > It is exactly what he is stating in the starting paragraph, and repeats again later - the reason for pulling in agnosticism seems to be to better explain atheism.
These agnostics go beyond the problems of evidence and consider the problem of whether there could exist such a God. < - > Confusion which ''but unlike the atheist he does not think that he is justified in saying that God does not exist or, stronger still, that God cannot exist.'' and ''Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not'' from Nielsen clears up.
To talk about mystery, they maintain, is just an evasive way of talking about what is not understood. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
Most of the paragraph in question is about distinctions based on meaningfulness and referent rather than questions about existence. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
The parenthetic/appositive (with unclearly distributed scope) 3-words ''unlike the atheist'' cannot be taken out of context to override the extensive treatment they give that is contrary to your interpretation --which does not distinguish ''God'' from God.-- < - > Nobody has agreed that the response you got from someone at EB resolves anything in your favour--
Grow a pair. < - > even alot of people who do understand it might think that it's overly technical.
I agree that that topic is not adequately handled in the wiki article. < - > Only three words [''unlike the atheist''] are about any atheist position on existence (existence appeared in his comprehensive definition of atheism only with respect to an anthropomorphic God.
The clearest, universally distributed statement about atheists he makes in the paragraph in question is: Atheists... < - > Eldamorie, many dictionaries and encyclopedias contrast agnosticism as a matter of course, indeed that is the role of agnosticism in the EB article, they happen to have a complete article on agnosticism as well - but Nielsen seems to bring it in exactly because it is relevant to properly understanding atheism in context.
because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers... < - > Any wish to interpret the opening paragraph as something else than a summary is an extraordinary claim - EB is not alone in contrasting atheism with agnosticism along the very same lines.

It's very hard to describe such behaviour rationally and in an encyclopaedic way. < - > The reason it is necessary to have a vague word like ''perceived'' is of course because blackness is relative and a person whose skin is classified as white in the Dominican Republic or Brazil may be classified as Black in the US.

When talking about human genetic or linguistic history, ''oldest branch'' would refer to the group that split off earliest from the mainstream population; for example, we can talk about the Anatolian languages are the oldest branch of Indo-European because they have both innovations and archaic features that are not shared by any other attested Indo-European languages. < - > If the Catholic Church reacts to a new religion like Scientology, that doesn't make the Catholic Church a new religion.

However, that's different than what most people are likely to think it would mean: actually, all branches of Indo-European or of Buddhism are equally old, because they all go back to the same source (otherwise, it would be a mistake to think of them as branches). < - > It's worth noting that the neither of the two surviving Mahāyāna vinaya traditions, viz China and Tibet, use the Mahāsāṃghika vinaya.—

Within that context, the entire subject of centrifugal force is very simple, unified, and coherent, but without making use of that formalism (which requires a level of abstraction that is unfamiliar to some), it splits into seemingly disjoint subjects, hence all the forking. < - > Therefore, instead of saying, for example, that the trajectory of a stone dropped out of a running train is a straight line for a train observer and a parabola for a ground observer, it is better to say that the trajectory is a straight line in the train's frame of reference and a parabola in the ground's frame of reference.

Partly also because everyone has an intuitive notion of centrifugal force that gives it a reality not easily supplanted by abstract arguments about ''frames of reference''. < - > Of course, more general, non-planar trajectories along 3-dimensional curves could also be treated by extending the formalism to include things like torsion.
By broadening the discussion to treat fictitious forces in general, rather than the very particular centrifugal force, a very general treatment for the case of particle motion in both inertial and non-inertial frames employing Cartesian coordinates is provided at fictitious force. < - > What you most likely mean is something like ''the results of measurements performed by observers in disparate states of motion''.
Within that context, the entire subject of centrifugal force is very simple, unified, and coherent, but without making use of that formalism (which requires a level of abstraction that is unfamiliar to some), it splits into seemingly disjoint subjects, hence all the forking. < - > are they rotating?

I'd say further that the standard and predominant viewpoint of classical mechanics is this one, As already explained, predominant does not imply exclusive. < - > Thus, the available literature treats the matter in a manner consistent with the articles.
So your argument is moot, either way. < - > Does anyone know if this is a regretful coincidence or manipulation?
Well, yeah. < - > I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''.
Hence your excursion into Labrangian mechanics is pointless. < - > Here is the quote from the article (where links can be found): Treat the fictitious forces like real forces, and pretend you are in an inertial frame.
In any case, I think it's fair to say that the ''predominance'' mentioned by Brews is not a fact in evidence. < - > In fact, the above comments just give another display of the very problem that Harald mentioned.
That sentence is false. < - > A second approach is to work directly in the rotating frame, where use of Newton's laws requires introduction of fictitious forces.
The above line-by-line critique is Fugal's opinion, no doubt, but is it supported by any fact or anybody? < - > So here is the dilemma: if the standard usage of centrifugal force is used, as in the present article, the result is an article consonant with the vast majority of the literature and with the common use of ''centrifugal force''.
His ideas are not supported by any reputable sources (not to mention that they are also false). < - > In such an abstract formulation, it is mathematically handy to treat every as a so-called ''acceleration'' and everything else as a ''fictitious force''.
In the Newtonian equation of motion, F = ma, these three components of the acceleration, multiplied by the mass, are sometimes brought over to the force side of the equation, and treated as fictitious forces. < - > You could just as well choose a coordinate system in terms of which that object is presently being subjected to a million tons of centrifugal force, in any direction you choose.
No wonder we're having so much trouble communicating. < - > (Needless to say, no one would mistake this for a claim that relative acceleration is absolute acceleration.) The quoted comment asserting that inertial forces do not represent interactions between bodies is somewhat sporty, and would raise eye-brows in more sophisticated circles, because we do not know whether inertia is ultimately attributable to interactions between bodies.
And you present no rational justification for suppressing what is obviously a variety of views on the subject of fictitious centrifugal force in rotating frames. < - > But this choice is strictly arbitrary.
Then at some later point in the article the subtlety of frames versus coordinate systems can be mentioned, at least to the extent of explaining how the terms selected to be treated as forces are chosen. < - > When this is done, the symbol ''a'' in the equation of motion represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating frame, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively.
I haven't mentioned the fact that many (perhaps even most) modern texts discourage the use of fictitious forces altogether, although I think it might be appropriate to mention this later in the article. < - > I say say bring back Tombe and let him write this as you guys are going nowhere with it as it now stands [unpunctuated and unsigned message, apparently left by IP server 71.251.184.32.] I'm not sure if the above comment was some kind of vandalism, or was meant to be taken seriously.
This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame). < - > You can use coordinate systems and coordinate transformations to translate from one reference frame to another, but they are not the same thing.
In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the coordinate system differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > An interesting discussion of the reality of fictitious forces is provided by Kompaneyets:Kompaneet︠s︡, A.
I'm not sure. < - > The centrifugal force is directed outward from the axis of rotation.
When this is done, the symbol ''a'' represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating coordinates, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively. < - > These forces are usually called inertial forces.
I agree that this article should not state or imply that the only meaning of ''centrifugal force'' is the ''fictitous force in rotating frames'' meaning, not that that is the only context (within classical mechanics) in which the term ''centrifugal force'' is used. < - > You plainly have not the slightest understanding of this subject, and aren't even equipped with the vocabulary or the conceptual background to discuss it rationally.

The proposed language is simply an example of words reduced to meaningless. < - > This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame).
I should have commented specifically on Wolf's statement, when he said ''This article about physics is independent of the coordinate system used...''. < - > In [the equation for acceleration] this acceleration is written as if it were due to some additional forces.
This wording is, I believe, provides an accurate, clear, and NPOV introduction to this article. < - > http://books.google.com/books?id=CQ2gBrL5T4YC&pg=PA73&dq=centrifugal+%22polar+coordinates%22&lr=&as_brr=0&sig=ACfU3U109_XqmTpT1HZDqQ8JW7RKGQPALQ#PPA71,M1.  ''Naturally, the acceleration of a point caused by noninertiality of the system is absolutely real, relative to that system, in spite of the fact that there are other, inertial, systems relative to which this acceleration does not exist.
Here's another version of the proposed introduction that might be more paletable, based on the above discussion: In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a reference frame rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the reference frame differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > Coordinate systems are not reference frames.- (
The definition used is overwhelmingly the same as this article; very few use other definitions. < - > Now look at the following two assertions: Centrifugal force is an outward fictitious force in a rotating frame.
It's mostly the article you helped to write Harald.- ( < - > For example taking the rotating earth frame and including the rotation effect of the earth in apparent gravitation, this action-reaction pair is still measured on a merry-go-round.
My proposal for getting started on that task is presented in the previous section here on this discussion page. < - > This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''.
Careful here. < - > As it stands, this article is not just about rotating reference frames, despite it's parenthetical disambiguation.
This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > An outward fictitious force in a rotating frame is called Centrifugal force.
The old article talked about reactive centrifugal force, that's completely orthogonal to rotating reference frames; you can either, neither or both. < - > However, at the moment that page is more or less hidden while it should be the departure point after typing ''centrifugal force''.
Then this entire debate could be squelched and the tags on this article removed. < - > This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer.
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims. < - > In diplomacy one curries favor where and when one can.
Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church, but it isn't larger than Christianity and isn't a single body (there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi'a for a start), so I don't actually think that this is an especially significant fact. < - > The Holy See does not have very good relationship with the Muslim world based upon the pope's past comments and positions.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I viewed it as purely political in motivation.

The Roman Catholic Church, with around a billion members, is the largest single religious body. < - > We could simply present it from the angle it has already been presented: The Vatican concedes Islam now bigger than Roman Catholicism.'' That's what I wrote as a comment in that discussion.
The Vatican sees itself in direct competition with Islam. < - > I viewed it as purely political in motivation.
Perhaps someone can correct me, as I'm far from an expert on Islam; but it doesn't seem consistent to me to regard Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Protestantism as separate ''faiths'', while regarding all branches of Islam as the same faith.(It may, however, be the case that even Sunni Muslims, who make up about 85% of Muslims, outnumber Catholics; but that doesn't seem to be the story as presented). < - > Any intelligent Mulsim would see it as hallow; there is no equivalency between Catholics and Muslims as has been adequately explained above.

I think the idea is to have a broad representation of source material. < - > The eleventh hour revelation of using children's books as source material really dealt the killing blow to this article's credibility.--
Just a heads up. < - > Also, quite a few editors act as vandal fighters and step in when needed.
I guess the most important thing to do now is to complete the to do list. < - > The picture does not illustrate any specific point to advance the article.
I will try to help you as much as I can since I am very interested in this subject and I think we could make this not just a good but a featured article one day. < - > I would be OK with the removal.
Still, I am reasonable enough to agree to keep it out if you present some other argument (other than censorship) < - > I've rearranged and altered the pictures a little.

Too specific (pertains to only 1/40th of its history). < - > I was thinking myself that it wasn't really a lead matter, and since that sentence is duplicated virtually word for word at its proper place in the article, it should go.
I am OK either way. < - > Lets all examine the lead and come to consensus because this is a very important part of the article.
I ask as I have been doing some minor tidying up of the lede, hopefully to read better and to shorten slightly without losing any important content. < - > I vote to keep the sentence.
In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context, whereas the rest of the lede is very general, broad, and top-down sounding. < - > Removing it will leave a hole in logic and prevent the reader from knowing a key detail about what the church thinks about itself.
However, given that I am hearing one ''doesn't matter'' and one (apparently) ''no keep as is'', I am glad I brought it up first, and any further input welcome and indeed desired. < - > After considering the sentence everyone is discussing about removing in the lead, I think it really fits and ties up well the sentences that precede it.
That sentence is also in the Beliefs section under subsection ''church''. < - > The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic according to reliable, published sources.

Lets have a quick look at your criticisms: A lot seem to based on a perception, that many people in certain countries with anti-catholic backgrounds have been brought up with, that the Catholic Church was basically an evil, grisly organisation, and that there must be more to back this up. < - > Would that be a balanced picture - or POV?

It is only rationale to consider this a list of topics ''what have been characterized as'' as there is no way to properly source whether something is ''currently characterized as''! < - > So now we are not definitively labelling anything pseudoscience.
Of course, as I've said, I have not been over all of the old talk yet so I may be incorrect in what Ludwigs2's stances have really been and what has actually happened on this article. < - > --

The issue that brought this up had to do with some disagreement over whether to include two theories, specifically meteorites and continental drift, that have long been considered scientific (or ''real'' phenomena if you prefer) by the scientific community. < - > We could call this ''List of pseudosciences'' where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included.

Let's tell the whole story of this characterization. < - > It also has to pass the parity test, i.e.
This is not a list of topics that are characterized as a pseudoscience in light of current, or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method. < - > But as I also said, I believe editors should attempt to be collectively clearer, i.e.
Above, I said, ''When we allow some notable gray and not some other notable gray, then this article will suffer of NPOV violations.'' What I meant was that we can't pick-and-choose which notable sources we want to use and which ones we don't based on the merits of which topics the sources are characterizing as pseudoscience. < - > However, I do not see why Levine2112, Ludwigs2, and Unomi think that there is a problem with WP:PSCI as is.
This is a list of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable person or group at some point in time for all of history. < - > --
However, this is not such a list. < - > I believe the core of Ludwigs2's argument is correct.
Because most of us here - myself included - would agree that psychoanalysis or Darwinism is not pseudoscientific, we are reluctant to allow their inclusion in this list regardless of whether or not we have notable sources asserting such a characterization. < - > Or Dr.
I agree that if a source ''recanted the characterization'' we should talk about that. < - > But when we act like this - when we disallow based on our own views - then we have an NPOV problem on our hands.
Trying to paraphrase your argument, you say that reliable sources should be used, but that some editors only want to use reliable sources that are authoritative voices regarding pseudoscientific concepts. < - > Based on the discussion to rename this article, it doesn't seem like this would have much support.
Please stop edit warring to reintroduce this badly written and unsupported paragraph. < - > The problem was and is that this list does not serve as an explanation of the philosophical concept of a pseudoscience, but as a coatrack for fringe-bashing.
See, e.g., ''Science and Pseudo-science'' in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy online, which gives some sources about Popper's little gaffe. < - > We could call this ''List of pseudosciences'' where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included.

Severa, the  thing is no problem. < - > However, I agree with you about those who seek to portray all abortions in the same way (although it is *quite* possible to find quite graphic photos for most surgical procedures and the saline abortion method).
I took a look at the [[List of surgical procedures] and went through every operation, one by one. < - > I'm not sure of your claim that pharmaceutical abortions are more prevalent than surgical ones.

if your answer is yes, I await your edit to the page (as I see you have done much editing to it, and will leave it to you) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the ''Hamas'' page. < - > No doubt you will bring attention to the statement: ''...would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated'' ...in order to argue that U.S./israeli actions are ''necessary'' and achieve a (relatively) successful military goal and that, in turn, justify the actions making them allowable by the standards of the convention.

However, judging by the above, the Salon article is about Hamas and the ripost does belong in our WP article. < - > I've already addressed that argument, several times: Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was ''rejected'' in the Hezbollah case (it was not), it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance (different time, different place, different organization) is also the case in this instance.

if people are that interested in it, they will find a link in the article. < - > Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect, compassion and sensitivity, also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong.
There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article. < - > Mmmmmm, you don't know me at all. :-) I have no favorite scandals.
Does that still fit in the lead? < - > But, really...
You may wish to make the Catholic Church all about abuse scandals, but that doesn't make it acceptable to skew the entire article. < - > You are being patient and nice, and I appreciate that.
That is very much in line with modern thought and not a ''controversy''. < - > That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion, contraception and euthanasia though, which I feel is important to point out if we're going to directly address those issues.

Still, I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits. < - > Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements'' (emphasis added).
They have no place in the introduction. < - > I think it is important for the article to state this percentage to put the scandal in perspective.
Nancy suggested just omitting them altogether, but I think other editors might disagree. < - > What is most recent is not necessarily what is most notable: new information should be carefully balanced against old, with due weight accorded to each.'' Given the 2,000 year history of the church, the sex abuse scandals hardly register when compared with the persecution by Roman emperors, Arian heresy, schism of 1054, Reformation, and French revolution.

I'm not so keen on: Suggested re-wording: Modern challenges faced by the church include the rise of secularism, and controversy over its prohibition of abortion, contraception and euthanasia. < - > I'm also concerned that the reason the Church opposed some forms of contraception isn't because condoms kill babies, but because of their view on sex and marriage.-
How about: ''Over the centuries, the church has engaged controversies of many kinds. < - > There are similar issues in Ireland and other parts of Europe, and somewhere earlier on this talk page someone brought up a book written about 2000 years of sex scandals in the RCC, so it's not necessarily a new thing either.
You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight, which exactly clarifies the point that I am making: ''An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. < - > Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.'' Have at it!
They have no place in the introduction. < - > It is very unfair to all of the faithful, hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them.
Highly-publicised cases of sexual abuse by clergy in the United States and Ireland led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse. < - > When we do mention pro-life, we just shouldn't separate contraception too far.
Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. < - > It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought.
It is certainly not for the introduction sefction to the church.I am sorry, you are NOT deciding what goes in the lead of the Catholic Church article. < - > And why are we still using the non-Catholic word ''pro-life'' ( consistent life ethic may work better).

Do the two different forms of mass need to be discussed in detail in this article? < - > I think everyone is trying to build a good article in good faith.
Please note that the article does not in any way assign blame to BP, something that is beyond the scope here. < - > I gave an example text above which eschews the blame game and other details best explored elsewhere, although I conceded at the time that it was only an initial draft.
When all is said and done the event might be worth a section this long, or maybe shorter, and we will have to make room for the rest of the story as it arises. < - > But if someone wants to remove aspects of this, I have a hard time imagining it will be as responsible a representation of what is left, and I'd like to see these points addressed, not just undertaken.
Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article. < - > Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP's failure to stop this early, as their plan suggested they could and would; yet at the same time, it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil, considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month. < - > You seem to be saying that we should have a link to what a drilling rig is.
If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this, that's what wikilinks are for. < - > And, while BP was 65% owner of the field, and so of the oil gushing from that field, the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals, and the investigations are looking into their actions, inactions and histories as much as BP's.
CNN has an article about Obama personally promising to triple the cleanup manpower [43]. < - > Thanks.
The reader doesn't need any more than by way of introduction, before reading about what this has to do with Obama, in order to understand Obama's life and times in 80,000 characters or less. < - >  ;)
On May 28, 2010, Obama said ''I take responsibility. < - > We could fight any mention of the spill, or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world, and err on the side of making this section, you know, bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care (both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated).
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > And they are based on public perception, not legal conclusions or proven facts.
It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly. < - > Thanks.
In theory, a good idea. < - > —Preceding unsigned comment added by
-- < - > I'm afraid ''Obama's Katrina'' has all the hallmarks of a senseless political meme, like calling everything ''-gate''.
For example, Gerald Ford had a dog is not clear. < - > Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.
I should note that Bobby Jindal doesn't mention the spill either, which is equally ridiculous. < - > I hope it can be confined to large-scale water-borne disasters in the Gulf of Mexico, but I'm afraid from now on out, every time there is any lingering problem that a government leader cannot quickly fix they'll call it X's Katrina.
We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina. < - > I'm not an apologist for BP, who should pay every penny they owe and then some, and may well do so, but I am trying to use the record to correct the recounting of the way the newsiness has unfolded, or the abbreviated version of such, neither of which is remotely encyclopedic.
We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina. < - > Gerald Ford had a dog, Liberty is better.
There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article. < - > Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings, and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout.
I fully agree. < - > Obama's role, and the public's expectations of his administration, revolve mostly around BP so far, not Haliburton or Transocean.
If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this, that's what wikilinks are for. < - > Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.
I'll say it again, if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama's biography, I will not object at all. < - > As to your point about piping, I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic.
I should note that Bobby Jindal doesn't mention the spill either, which is equally ridiculous. < - > Until and unless one of the abovementioned things, or some other major detail, arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end, I really don't see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers.
I would suggest something more like this: Following a blowout at an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to review and report on the events surrounding incident. < - > Okay, I've made some minor cleanups and corrections.
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead. < - > -
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean (allegedly faultily, with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks, indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton (allegedly shoddily; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year).
IMO that part is fine as it is. < - > The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs.
-I agree that the full Nicene Creed should stay. < - > Could she clarify those?; perhaps there is indeed more merit to those suggestions than I can currently see.
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page. < - > I think readers who are unfamiliar with the RCC or other Christian religions which use the Nicene Creed won't necessarily understand what it is saying.
Also, eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes. < - > Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence.
Re the moves, I understand that this really is an editorial decision, but one that does have other implications, as you allude to (although ones I did not understand; see below). < - > It still appears to me that driving the organization of the article so as to make these connections explicit risks giving the article assertive connotations, something that I think we all agree should be avoided, whether or not we agree it will actually happen as I suggest.
The section is probably too long, as I have already said. < - > If one were asked to write about a poem, one wouldn't just re-print the entire poem ...with the implication of 'read it for yourself, it is so obvious.' Almost all Christendom ascribes to the creed.
Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues. < - > While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown, there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV.
I could go either way; I just want it to be accurate and grammatical.I've made some small changes to the lead wording for improvement of flow. < - > The RC article managed for five years without having your favourite scandal in the lead.
I will put the figure in when I get it. < - > Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession, whether it be a doctor, dentist, store worker, gym instructor, etc...
if people are that interested in it, they will find a link in the article. < - > I know y'all will be unhappy, but these changes won't fly.
Karnacs, many people may ''know'' about scandals in the Catholic church, but rather than distorting historical perspective, something like Summorum Pontificum is a much bigger current event as far as the Catholic church is concerned. < - > I'm still trying to be very patient and nice, but good granny, if you don't read the policies/essays/etc., don't quote 'em.
I fixed the fragment, but if you want to word it better, go right ahead.-- < - > This then raises the question of NPOV, which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals.
This then raises the question of NPOV, which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals. < - > The child abuse scandals are also not strictly a US issue, although the article does not do a good job of pointing that out.

There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article. < - > That being said, there's no real need to mention it in the introduction; your edit seems fine from my end.

Omitting the scandals is in keeping with the historical perspective encouraged by WP:LEAD. < - > I have no axe to grind — not pro-life or pro-choice or pro-homosexual or pro-anything except pro- WP:V and pro- WP:NPOV.
That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion, contraception and euthanasia though, which I feel is important to point out if we're going to directly address those issues. < - > If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead, my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused.
I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church. < - > Given the 2000 year history of the church, and all the things associated with the church, I'd say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight, based on prominence of placement.
I think full discussion of something like that would belong in Anticatholicism or Criticism of the Catholic Church of which we already have an article dedicated to. < - > Karnacs, many people may ''know'' about scandals in the Catholic church, but rather than distorting historical perspective, something like Summorum Pontificum is a much bigger current event as far as the Catholic church is concerned.
I say it doesn't belong in the lead, but I am willing to tolerate it there. < - > This is the first time such a demand has been made, and it is utterly unreasonable.
However, I think we will be hit over the head a few times if we dont have any controversies noted in the lead. < - > Given the 2000 year history of the church, and all the things associated with the church, I'd say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight, based on prominence of placement.
Strongly suggest you write an article about the sex scandals, if one doesn't exist. < - > However, the child sex scandals have had a profound affect on the Catholic Church: see LA Times 'Catholicism Losing Ground in Ireland:Secularism, prosperity and sexual abuse scandals are weakening the church's influence.' 17 April 2005].
It is not the quantity of text that bothers me. < - > Oh, sorry, I misunderstood - trying to read all of this is a mess.

I agree to a point RE:Duffy; I don't think he needs to be named and the opinion of one historian should not carry undue weight.Nothing wrong with ref 17; shows a variety of sources...you can't write simply from the POV of the church as an institution is always in the right...they screwed the pooch on how they handled the abuse cases as well as the lies they put out whenever a Pope dies.-- < - > I don't know if there's a children's book printed on this yet.--Do you remember ''Deposit of Faith''?

On the other hand, it's similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on, either before or after, as reliably sourced, and further, to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out. < - > In the lead sentence we establish that an explosion at an oil rig in the gulf caused the rig's destruction and an uncontrolled flow of oil into the gulf.

In regards to the back and forth here, I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit, and Scjessey's response(while it does look POVish) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency. < - > I hope it can be confined to large-scale water-borne disasters in the Gulf of Mexico, but I'm afraid from now on out, every time there is any lingering problem that a government leader cannot quickly fix they'll call it X's Katrina.

When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > (in an introduction or elswhere in the article) Again - I ask you to please provide evidence of the thriving Armenian colony where Ottoman Armenians were ''deported'' to by the CUP.
''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide? < - > This discussion about the use of the word ''deportations'' is over as far as I am concerned.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > You are suggesting making changes to the introduction of the article to correct semantic and not actually substantive errors.
The word ''deportations'' has been used since 1915 in relation to the Armenian genocide; one of the best known document's produced to illustrate the genocide's effects is the map titled ''The Routes of Deportations'' first published back in 1920. < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > On the contrary, I will always make suggestions for important changes to the article here in the talk page first, and will always engage with those wishing to make a positive contribution and will try to incorporate the reasonable views of others in any proposals I make.
I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians. < - > However, the talk page is not a forum to discuss the Armenian genocide or a forum to confront genocide denialists and their propaganda, it is actually a place to discuss the improvement of the Wikipedia entry on the Armenian Genocide.
So while I appreciate (and agree with) the points you are trying to make - lets not fall into the trap of accepting (essentially) denialist (and false) terminology.-- < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
It seems obvious to me - considering the scholarly analysis and the known historical record - that no Armenians were actually deported anywhere. < - > You, on the other hand, just seem to use this talk page as a platform on which to display your ego as you bash about the head visiting genocide denialists.
Some scholars (and Turkish apologists) point to some of the first ''deportations'' being from Eastern Anatolia to Konya (though most never made it that far and even those who did were qucikly re-uprooted and sent South into the desert...) - where the aim of the CUP apeared to be only lessening of the concentration of Armenians in what had been (in years prior) predominantly Armenian Areas (which were still very culturally Armenian). < - > So if we are attempting to change the introduction to improve accuracy - particularly in regards to semantics - then I would suggest we do it right.
I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)? < - > I agree that the term used be ''forced (death) marches'', for infact that is exactly what was used by the Ottoman Empire.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > Anyway I am all in favor of your contributing to the article itself in the manner you have proposed and I will certainly comment on particulars that I am either in favor of or oppose though I have no desire to be dictatorial in any way.

The manual of style dictates how articles are named, it being roughly ''The name by which something is most widely known in English, by which English-speakers are most likely to recognise it and refer to it''. < - > A very small minority dissent from this position, and if that dissent came from anywhere other than Turkey's government, we'd probably give it even less weight.

These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''. < - > On WP it doesn't matter how logical we, as editors, think an argument is, what matters is how logical or important the correct sources say it is.
If I am permitted to do that, I can prove statistically that goobles wurble whenever one cages a sage in the flowering season, and do so with a significance of better than 0.0001. < - > The first sentence (''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.'') is quite sufficient, otherwise we have a ridiculous and unacceptable situation when the mainstream views (Carlson) are being discussed in lesser details than the fringe sources that criticise them.
Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. < - > It is also somewhat ironic that the text of WP:PARITY makes it clear that it was intended to allow for non-peer reviewed criticisms of fringe theories (the cited example is criticisms of moon landing conspiracy theories) into articles covering those fringe theories, and you are applying it in reverse here.
That means that these journals are simply not scientific, and should be considered as self-published sources. < - > Peer review of meaningless rubbish however, is a far trickier thing.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > I have no problem with reading comprehension.
Please do not change my signature, play with your own. < - > You are right in the sense that ''Astrologers disagree'' with Carlson's conclusions - though that statement invites the comment - they would, wouldn't they?
It looks like I got here too late, the page has already been unlocked. < - > Just follow these simple steps...
Try as they might, astrologers are unable to systematize their claims and evidence, and every single astrological hypothesis that has been scrutinized has been duly rejected and falsified enough to make all claims of scientific validity a pathological science. < - > Yet, most new editors invited in from outside are expected to understand the detail and the nuances from a snapshot.
This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Any mention of the opinion of these journals to criticize Nature would be a serious NPOV violation, specifically DUE, as well as an RS problem. < - > Easy as pie.
At any rate, that is what my peers say. < - > Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis Perform an experiment and collect data, testing the hypothesis Analyze the data Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis Publish results (in actual peer-reviewed journals) Retest and refine (frequently done by other scientists) We call this science and it is the only method humans have for accurately predicing the future.
Alternatively, we can refer only to the opinion of Eysenck, who is notable enough to be explicitly mentioned. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > It can be seen that many RFC contributors have failed to realise that the reference to the Carlson criticism is not a vindication of astrology, merely an indication that this study, like the Gauquelin study, has been blighted by significant controversy.
I concur with others that there might be some problems with the phrasing of the RfC above. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Fringe journals publish what can't be published elsewhere because it wouldn't meet real scientific scrutiny. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
Oppose To using this phrasing or another, per the reasons I have given previously. < - > I will not support this RFC - this has nothing to do with ''honoring community consensus''.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > I think the old encyclopedias were better and I've heard others say it too.
Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. < - > Making a blanket statement that you will not honor the community consensus, regardless of what it is, is probably not going to be helpful to you or your position, and throws up a major red flag in terms of your ability to engage in wikipedia productively.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > Good editors have contributed to this RFC discussion in good faith, but not having been exposed to the full arguments and the consequences of them.
If you follow the threads you will see that in this instance, two of the psychology professors Eysenck and Ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write ''Scientists disagree...'' or ''Psychologists disagree ...''. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
If it's not then it's not big deal, but if it is and it's not posted then it doesn't give the review admin all the information s/he may need. < - > Oppose The edit conflict seems to be between a small group, who are trying to give fringe sources parity with reliable ones, and a larger group determined to maintain the distinction between the two.
Thank you. < - > This is a very inappropriate remark.
Some editors at Astrology are intent on adding the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature into the article (see here for full context: [[5]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Modern astrology is bunk so say the experts who are in the know.
Oppose inclusion per WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE. < - > This is not to reflect poorly on you as an editor, but rather it allows the reviewing admin to take into account what might be relevant to your contribution.
There are a number of reliable secondary sources that could be used instead. < - > Based on the results of this RFC, I suggest we ask for unprotection since there is a clear consensus to remove.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > The correct question, therefore, is ''should we add it?''
And I could get peers to review it too. < - > Oppose.
IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
The policy you are quoting is in regards to subjects that are not discussed in mainstream journals, and we should not expect to find, e.g., distinctions in and arguments between different schools of ''Creation Science'' in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. < - > IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it.
The rest of your argument is not relevant for this reason. < - > This is a distinction that seems to be hard for some folks to grasp but it's one that really needs grasping as all these attempts to use fringe sources in this way are simply beating a dead horse and ignoring policy.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > Whilever well known controversies like this receive no acknowledgement or mention in sources such as WP, adherents will feel vindicated in their belief that there is more to astrology than the scientific establishment is prepared to accept.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
Unless a convincing argument is presented otherwise, keep the Carlson paper, and ditch the fringe criticisms. < - > That's a misrepresentation of what I have said.
What phenomenon is this article about, anyway: academic conceptions of atheism, or atheism as actually practiced? < - > If you wish to argue that EB does not reflect the consensus position then I would have to say that you are making an extraordinary claim that you need to make a case for.
Thomas Huxley, for instance, was unhappy with ''atheism'' because it was too dogmatic; it made a definitive metaphysical claim about the nonexistence of God, for which Huxley believed there was insufficient evidence. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed. < - > ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘Read Eller again, he is in fact saying that it is positive denial and that negative denial in fact reduces to positive denial.
In Michael Martin. < - > None whatsoever.
There are lots of counterexamples, and the text of the current article cites some of them. < - > You have also failed to establish that the EB article represents a ''consensus'' view as opposed to the particular conceptualisation of one particular writer.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > There is indeed a usage that interprets atheism as an index of certainty or dogmatism, an interpretation that is challenged by the work of many atheists who do not claim certainty.
I should also note that ''rejects'' is increasingly, it seems, becoming a term of art where the usage in scholarly works on philosophy is not the same as the lay reading allows - certainly if the lay reading entertains the notion that it is not expressing a certainty about a proposition. < - > The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed.
The distiniction is small but important. < - > That said, I think that we should probably include mention of the tendency to desire a redefinition of atheism that seems to make it overlap that of agnosticism.
Rather, they would hold that an atheist is a person without a belief in God. < - > Further on Gordon Stein and An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism see Martins review here where he notes ( emphasis mine ) ''The section on the meaning of atheism is also of particular interest, primarily for showing that in the past many atheists have not meant by atheism what is meant by that term today.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > I agree that there is diversity of opinion demonstrated in RS, but we should absolutely give primacy to the consensus position, and such a position does indeed exist as is made clear by EB and the majority of dictionaries and encyclopaedias.
This led those who were unable to subscribe to orthodox theism to coin new terms of self-definition, which would allow them to remain uncontaminatcd by the stigma of atheism. < - > 1) Which source do you believe adequately counters the claim that the modern consensus is ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.''?
2) Maybe I'm confused about the ''matter at hand''. < - > Obviously, Unomi, it does matter how atheists have defined atheism.
This is of course later eviscerated by Drange - to which there seems to have been little answer, but loads of IDHT. < - > You can't maintain that atheism is consensually ''a positive denial'' when Eller, for one, says it isn't a positive denial.
Well into the nineteenth century, the negative connotations of the word - as a term of abuse - persisted and came increasingly to be associated with immorality and lawlessness, two of the great fears of the nineteenth-century mind. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
To be without a belief in God merely means that yhe term ''god'' has no importance, or possibly no meaning, to you. < - > There is no consensus, contemporary or otherwise, that atheism requires certainty.
But I suspect that other editors may object. < - > On reflection, I would strongly favour the removal of all but the first paragraph from the introduction; the content in those paragraphs belongs in the main body of the article.
We are defining an -ism, so why would the reader not see the definition and its analogues as a refusal to accept a belief as their own? < - > If you tell me that ''my dog eats garbage'' could actually be understood to mean ''some dogs drink brandy'' I'm going to tell you that's not possible.
What I don't understand Peter, is how you missed the one meaning that the clause has to 99% of readers, and is meant to have. < - > It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for.
Griswaldo and Modocc, have you considered that some people have an interest in how the definitions are used because of how they identify themselves rather than it being a mere pushing against others who identify themselves differently? < - > It seems to me that we are discussing two entirely different things here, and I have low enthusiasm for the two of them, taken together.
So how does one get from this explicit rejection of belief in their existence to ''but not necessarily their existence?'' One simply doesn't because it isn't semantically viable. < - > Cheers.
This will continue until the rhetorical fad that is currently ongoing dies down. < - > Indeed!
As for the possible ambiguities, there is nothing ambiguous about not accepting a religion because you don't accept everything they espouse hook, line and sinker. < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
Tryptofish, I'm not gonna argue or bicker about the introduction too much right now because I think the main game in Wikipedia's coverage is actually on the atheism sub-pages, where some sort of covert war is being fought to legitimise conspiracy theories about atheism, opposition to atheism, and the existence of shadowy 'movements'. < - > Please be advised that a sentence that begins ''This article explains a range of .
It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
The trouble with ''Atheism is the position that deities do not exist'' is that although the position that deities do not exist is atheism, so is the position that a belief that deities exist cannot be justified. < - > I would have low enthusiasm for a lead sentence that talks about the subject being ''difficult to define''.
Ergo, it seems to me that the opening is ambiguous and could benefit from a clearer exposition if one can be found. < - > No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists.
Oh I wish. < - > I'm receptive to a short-and-sweet first sentence, so long as the lead section, as a whole, goes on to cover the three definitions of long standing.
Does this treatment of ambiguity cover your concerns, IP editor? < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
(again, after edit conflicts):That suggestion is simply a restatement of the article's third sentence, or third definition and it is contrary to the Britannica's definition, the source that is cited. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
Well, the positive atheism stuff is probably okay to be restored as well, but I'm a little uncomfortable with the sourcing in that section. < - > I completely forgot about this – thanks for jogging my memory!
I'll reinstate the passage we are agreed on. < - > I'm not sure what the questions about sourcing were.
Unlike agnosticism, which leaves open the question of whether there is a God, atheism is a positive denial. < - > Nielsen is *arguing* for a particular conceptualisation of atheism, not merely reporting an existing consensus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/atheism?show=0&t=1323944845. < - > In the early to mid-19th century, many atheists were proto-noncognitivists in their stated positions.
They are not at odds, and EB states the exact same delineation between agnosticism and atheism, the problem is that you are misreading ''rejects'' - and failing to account for noncognitivism which is the basis for preferring rejects over ''false'' - but they ( as Nielsen makes clear in contrasting agnosticism and atheism ) reduce to the same thing by different routes. < - > I'm saying that you are interpreting ''positive denial'' to a) mean something it need not mean, and b) a a consensus posiiton which it is not actually claimed to be in the text.

hardcore. < - > To my way of thinking, when you opine that the vast majority of your fellow humans are basically out of their mind, because they believe in God where you don't, you're deliberately taking up a fringe position.
I think it is fine that he holds that view, but I think that the placement in that section is in error. < - > I was addressing the first sentence to Carinae, but the second sentence (about having it removed) to Johnuniq's comment.
Atheism used to mean something completely different to what it means today, so it is clear its meaning evolves over time. < - > That makes his inclusion inappopropriate in a discussion of the etymology of the word.

Setting aside what anyone thinks about Harris, I find the quote useful here (and rather innocuous), in that it simply documents one point of view within atheism, about what atheism does or does not mean. < - > In fact, there is considerable discussion of how the word has historically been used as an insult.
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > And at the risk of saying something that really ought to go without saying, Scjessey was absolutely correct to revert Unomi's deletion of the quote.
Harris seems to have very little in the way of background to be granted the presumption of an informed opinion either way, he is a neuroscientist with a BA in Philosophy who seems to not know or appreciate that theism is a back-formation from atheism. < - > While Harris may well be correct, the fact is that the word does exist, and has been used with various meanings (many poorly defined).
That is a special meaning of ''valid'' which is not how it is generally understood in much of Western culture & it is not explained. < - > Also, it is disputed that atheism IS a ''form of belief''.
The word ''valid'' is certainly in the source, but who can unpack what it means there? < - > This could be changed to Moreover, atheism also figures in certain religious and spiritual belief systems, such as Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Neopagan movements[13] such as Wicca.[14] Jainism and some forms of Buddhism and Hinduism do not advocate belief in gods.[15] The lede is an introduction -- the details can go in the body--
The idea that religion is dangerous is one often associated with atheism, as the section explains. < - > Better than mentioning both of them, in my opinion, would be mentioning neither, since the impact of religious belief (or lack thereof) on political activity is difficult to substantiate, and intrinsically controversial.
Philosophical discussions will often lack (or include bias-selected) empirical data -- I could cite examples within this very article -- but that doesn't make them ''unreliable'' or unworthy of inclusion. < - > Although I'm not in agreement, I can see why some might not think the actions of some atheists and atheistic regimes constitute a specific danger of that worldview.
It could use a rewrite though to focus more on atheism and less on atheists. < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
Zacharias indeed states ''Those who, in the name of Christ, have sought to kill in order to propagate their belief were acting in serious contradiction to...the gospel'', but atheism, as propounded by Sartre and Nietzsche, directly ''injunct[ed]...the demagogues...of the Third Reich'' —The real face of atheism, page 65. < - > Prominent atheists like Harris, Russel etc are perfectly suitable for the subject matter of this article.
@JJL - I think your suggested titles are better than any suggested so far (including what I had in mind). < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
Then I was going to expand on the last sentence of the article and report on the view of Dinesh D'Souza (who is mentioned in the Criticism of atheism page) and others that an atheistic worldview was/is the underpinning of brutal, totalitarian regimes like Soviet Russia. < - > Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism.
It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. < - > There is an entire article devoted to his religious views for those who care to read up on him.

You are correct that he utilized aspects of Christian philosophy in his public speeches an policies, but I suspect that he was being pragmatic rather than dogmatic. < - > I will also acknowledge that, although I've heard Muslims and others criticize atheism, I am not as familiar with specific sources of that criticism as I am Christian sources (and I don't know of any polytheists' criticism of atheism, although I wouldn't doubt it exists); if others here would like to direct me to such sources for the sake of presenting a wider criticism of atheism, I will look into them and try to incorporate them (although I'm trying to keep the section brief, and those broader arguments may be better made within the Criticism of Atheism article).
because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., “God” is just another name for love, or ... < - > It is exactly what he is stating in the starting paragraph, and repeats again later - the reason for pulling in agnosticism seems to be to better explain atheism.
These agnostics go beyond the problems of evidence and consider the problem of whether there could exist such a God. < - > Confusion which ''but unlike the atheist he does not think that he is justified in saying that God does not exist or, stronger still, that God cannot exist.'' and ''Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not'' from Nielsen clears up.
To talk about mystery, they maintain, is just an evasive way of talking about what is not understood. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
Most of the paragraph in question is about distinctions based on meaningfulness and referent rather than questions about existence. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
The parenthetic/appositive (with unclearly distributed scope) 3-words ''unlike the atheist'' cannot be taken out of context to override the extensive treatment they give that is contrary to your interpretation --which does not distinguish ''God'' from God.-- < - > Nobody has agreed that the response you got from someone at EB resolves anything in your favour--
Grow a pair. < - > even alot of people who do understand it might think that it's overly technical.
I agree that that topic is not adequately handled in the wiki article. < - > Only three words [''unlike the atheist''] are about any atheist position on existence (existence appeared in his comprehensive definition of atheism only with respect to an anthropomorphic God.
The clearest, universally distributed statement about atheists he makes in the paragraph in question is: Atheists... < - > Eldamorie, many dictionaries and encyclopedias contrast agnosticism as a matter of course, indeed that is the role of agnosticism in the EB article, they happen to have a complete article on agnosticism as well - but Nielsen seems to bring it in exactly because it is relevant to properly understanding atheism in context.
because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers... < - > Any wish to interpret the opening paragraph as something else than a summary is an extraordinary claim - EB is not alone in contrasting atheism with agnosticism along the very same lines.

I'm very concerned whether this article should be at ''Black people'' at all. < - > The last sentence of the intro reads: Other definitions of the term Black extend to any of the populations characterized by dark skin, a definition that also includes certain populations in Oceania, Southeast Asia.[1][2].
People coded as ''white'' benefit from its socio-political overtones whereas those coded as black are significantly disadvantaged by the label. < - > I find the title just ignorant and ambiguous.
As a black person, when I read this kind of sentence, I just roll my eyes. < - > And I would absolutely not dispute that claim.
It's very hard to describe such behaviour rationally and in an encyclopaedic way. < - > The reason it is necessary to have a vague word like ''perceived'' is of course because blackness is relative and a person whose skin is classified as white in the Dominican Republic or Brazil may be classified as Black in the US.

When talking about human genetic or linguistic history, ''oldest branch'' would refer to the group that split off earliest from the mainstream population; for example, we can talk about the Anatolian languages are the oldest branch of Indo-European because they have both innovations and archaic features that are not shared by any other attested Indo-European languages. < - > If the Catholic Church reacts to a new religion like Scientology, that doesn't make the Catholic Church a new religion.

However, that's different than what most people are likely to think it would mean: actually, all branches of Indo-European or of Buddhism are equally old, because they all go back to the same source (otherwise, it would be a mistake to think of them as branches). < - > It's worth noting that the neither of the two surviving Mahāyāna vinaya traditions, viz China and Tibet, use the Mahāsāṃghika vinaya.—

Within that context, the entire subject of centrifugal force is very simple, unified, and coherent, but without making use of that formalism (which requires a level of abstraction that is unfamiliar to some), it splits into seemingly disjoint subjects, hence all the forking. < - > Therefore, instead of saying, for example, that the trajectory of a stone dropped out of a running train is a straight line for a train observer and a parabola for a ground observer, it is better to say that the trajectory is a straight line in the train's frame of reference and a parabola in the ground's frame of reference.
It does not, however, treat general relativity and curvilinear coordinate systems. < - > It gives an impression that we are talking of a person looking at the phenomena, making appropriate measurements and possibly comparing them with those of another person.
and about what axis, oriented how?) and not upon their selection of coordinates (Cartesian, arc-length, etc.) to describe what they see. < - > for example, the frame of reference of a train is an abstract aitifact which has the same motion as thal of thc train.
Partly also because everyone has an intuitive notion of centrifugal force that gives it a reality not easily supplanted by abstract arguments about ''frames of reference''. < - > Of course, more general, non-planar trajectories along 3-dimensional curves could also be treated by extending the formalism to include things like torsion.
By broadening the discussion to treat fictitious forces in general, rather than the very particular centrifugal force, a very general treatment for the case of particle motion in both inertial and non-inertial frames employing Cartesian coordinates is provided at fictitious force. < - > What you most likely mean is something like ''the results of measurements performed by observers in disparate states of motion''.
Within that context, the entire subject of centrifugal force is very simple, unified, and coherent, but without making use of that formalism (which requires a level of abstraction that is unfamiliar to some), it splits into seemingly disjoint subjects, hence all the forking. < - > are they rotating?
Possible, but not necessary, and not done in most presentations today. < - > With these additional changes, I believe your concerns have been met and suggest the banner be removed.
It's perfectly simple. < - > Thus I moved the remaining banner (which I had placed) down to the first appropriate section (the current intro looks quite OK to me).
(Remember the discussion about how even Brews' source for the idea of the magical observer admits that it is a misleading concept and should be banished from our minds.) Also, what is the meaning of ''can be determined from Newton's laws by the introduction of fictitious forces...''? < - > With these additional changes, I believe your concerns have been met and suggest the banner be removed.
Very poetic. < - > Note: It appears that Bruce cut up the text by Fugal.
This illustrates the danger of unilateral action, because Brews always thinks he knows what people are objecting to, and he's (unfortunately) always wrong. < - > In all cases, there is a general meaning of an outward tendency associated with rotation in some sense.
That removal was instigated by PeR. < - > And of course he seems oblivious to the fact that it is the nature of a dispute that people disagree.
At some point, I think some mediation is going to be required. < - > It's just the first one.
We think of the accelerations as time rate-of change [per unit mass] of the linear momentum X' and y'. < - > Well, first, that is not correct, for the reasons explained on this Discussion page.
I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''. < - > The fact that I came directly on this page instead of on the disambiguation page, together with the false impression of the introduction sentences makes me wonder if someone purposefully tried to impose his POV on this topic, in opposition to what Wikipedia stands for.
Nobody here says that the term isn't used that way. < - > There was nothing abusive in my response, unless you consider that anyone who disagrees with you, and backs up their disagreement with detailed explanations and extensive references, is ''abusive''.
A complete and detailed treatment is in centrifugal force (planar motion). < - > The problem with the current article is that it seems determined to give the reader the impression that this one specialized sub-set of the subject of centrifugal force in classical mechanics constitutes the entire proper content of the subject.
Fugal: You might have a point that a better intro could be drafted in terms of some ethereal approach to the subject that you understand. < - > That is simply an incorrect and misleading statement.
As has already been explained repeatedly and at length, the references you mentioned (along with many others) explicitly support what I'm saying, and contradict what you are saying. < - > It would just simply be undue weight to include it here: WP:UNDUE.

That being the case, we end up with the article that we have here. < - > You are right that there is another usage for the term centrifugal force in the literature.
That is simply a novel narrative that you have personally fabricated, not supported by any reputable sources, and as such it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. < - > Just unclench and describe what the article's context is in an honest way, that accurately represents the published literature on the subject.Fugal (talk) 03:40, 21 September 2008 (UTC) Fugal, well said!
I'd say further that the standard and predominant viewpoint of classical mechanics is this one, As already explained, predominant does not imply exclusive. < - > Thus, the available literature treats the matter in a manner consistent with the articles.
So your argument is moot, either way. < - > Does anyone know if this is a regretful coincidence or manipulation?
Well, yeah. < - > I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''.
Hence your excursion into Labrangian mechanics is pointless. < - > Here is the quote from the article (where links can be found): Treat the fictitious forces like real forces, and pretend you are in an inertial frame.
In any case, I think it's fair to say that the ''predominance'' mentioned by Brews is not a fact in evidence. < - > In fact, the above comments just give another display of the very problem that Harald mentioned.
That sentence is false. < - > A second approach is to work directly in the rotating frame, where use of Newton's laws requires introduction of fictitious forces.
The above line-by-line critique is Fugal's opinion, no doubt, but is it supported by any fact or anybody? < - > So here is the dilemma: if the standard usage of centrifugal force is used, as in the present article, the result is an article consonant with the vast majority of the literature and with the common use of ''centrifugal force''.
His ideas are not supported by any reputable sources (not to mention that they are also false). < - > In such an abstract formulation, it is mathematically handy to treat every as a so-called ''acceleration'' and everything else as a ''fictitious force''.
In the Newtonian equation of motion, F = ma, these three components of the acceleration, multiplied by the mass, are sometimes brought over to the force side of the equation, and treated as fictitious forces. < - > You could just as well choose a coordinate system in terms of which that object is presently being subjected to a million tons of centrifugal force, in any direction you choose.
No wonder we're having so much trouble communicating. < - > (Needless to say, no one would mistake this for a claim that relative acceleration is absolute acceleration.) The quoted comment asserting that inertial forces do not represent interactions between bodies is somewhat sporty, and would raise eye-brows in more sophisticated circles, because we do not know whether inertia is ultimately attributable to interactions between bodies.
And you present no rational justification for suppressing what is obviously a variety of views on the subject of fictitious centrifugal force in rotating frames. < - > But this choice is strictly arbitrary.
Then at some later point in the article the subtlety of frames versus coordinate systems can be mentioned, at least to the extent of explaining how the terms selected to be treated as forces are chosen. < - > When this is done, the symbol ''a'' in the equation of motion represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating frame, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively.
I haven't mentioned the fact that many (perhaps even most) modern texts discourage the use of fictitious forces altogether, although I think it might be appropriate to mention this later in the article. < - > I say say bring back Tombe and let him write this as you guys are going nowhere with it as it now stands [unpunctuated and unsigned message, apparently left by IP server 71.251.184.32.] I'm not sure if the above comment was some kind of vandalism, or was meant to be taken seriously.
This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame). < - > You can use coordinate systems and coordinate transformations to translate from one reference frame to another, but they are not the same thing.
In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the coordinate system differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > An interesting discussion of the reality of fictitious forces is provided by Kompaneyets:Kompaneet︠s︡, A.
I'm not sure. < - > The centrifugal force is directed outward from the axis of rotation.
When this is done, the symbol ''a'' represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating coordinates, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively. < - > These forces are usually called inertial forces.
I agree that this article should not state or imply that the only meaning of ''centrifugal force'' is the ''fictitous force in rotating frames'' meaning, not that that is the only context (within classical mechanics) in which the term ''centrifugal force'' is used. < - > You plainly have not the slightest understanding of this subject, and aren't even equipped with the vocabulary or the conceptual background to discuss it rationally.
In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the coordinate system differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > How do you respond to this?
The proposed language is simply an example of words reduced to meaningless. < - > This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame).
I should have commented specifically on Wolf's statement, when he said ''This article about physics is independent of the coordinate system used...''. < - > In [the equation for acceleration] this acceleration is written as if it were due to some additional forces.
This wording is, I believe, provides an accurate, clear, and NPOV introduction to this article. < - > http://books.google.com/books?id=CQ2gBrL5T4YC&pg=PA73&dq=centrifugal+%22polar+coordinates%22&lr=&as_brr=0&sig=ACfU3U109_XqmTpT1HZDqQ8JW7RKGQPALQ#PPA71,M1.  ''Naturally, the acceleration of a point caused by noninertiality of the system is absolutely real, relative to that system, in spite of the fact that there are other, inertial, systems relative to which this acceleration does not exist.
Here's another version of the proposed introduction that might be more paletable, based on the above discussion: In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a reference frame rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the reference frame differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > Coordinate systems are not reference frames.- (
The definition used is overwhelmingly the same as this article; very few use other definitions. < - > Now look at the following two assertions: Centrifugal force is an outward fictitious force in a rotating frame.
It's mostly the article you helped to write Harald.- ( < - > For example taking the rotating earth frame and including the rotation effect of the earth in apparent gravitation, this action-reaction pair is still measured on a merry-go-round.
My proposal for getting started on that task is presented in the previous section here on this discussion page. < - > This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''.
Careful here. < - > As it stands, this article is not just about rotating reference frames, despite it's parenthetical disambiguation.
This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > An outward fictitious force in a rotating frame is called Centrifugal force.
The old article talked about reactive centrifugal force, that's completely orthogonal to rotating reference frames; you can either, neither or both. < - > However, at the moment that page is more or less hidden while it should be the departure point after typing ''centrifugal force''.
Then this entire debate could be squelched and the tags on this article removed. < - > This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer.
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims. < - > In diplomacy one curries favor where and when one can.
Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church, but it isn't larger than Christianity and isn't a single body (there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi'a for a start), so I don't actually think that this is an especially significant fact. < - > The Holy See does not have very good relationship with the Muslim world based upon the pope's past comments and positions.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I viewed it as purely political in motivation.

Perhaps someone can correct me, as I'm far from an expert on Islam; but it doesn't seem consistent to me to regard Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Protestantism as separate ''faiths'', while regarding all branches of Islam as the same faith.(It may, however, be the case that even Sunni Muslims, who make up about 85% of Muslims, outnumber Catholics; but that doesn't seem to be the story as presented). < - > Any intelligent Mulsim would see it as hallow; there is no equivalency between Catholics and Muslims as has been adequately explained above.

Hopefully, I've succeeded in compiling a list of all the images of abortion-related protests currently hosted on Wikipedia, so that we might pick and choose from among them. < - > Do we all agree that the pro-life image should be changed to Image:Pro-life protest.jpg?
Either way, I think it was great of you to find these and make them more accessible to us for our consideration. < - > -ProChoice: ProLife:-Are pictures of protesters really necessary in the article?
You could add pictures of protesters to get the idea across of what their group is like, but then it'd make more sense to just include it in the text, except it doesn't really seem relevant to the article. < - > I like agree with GT's idea, to use the first image from the first row, and the last from the second row.

Thats funny. < - > And I'm not trying to get a Personal life section in this article (though the Early life section also classifies as personal).
Though it seems that on March 5, 2009, it's getting bigger, not dying down. < - > But that's my stance.
Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY. < - > Not to mention...it's probably best not to duplicate that same exact information in both articles when there is no additional information in one of them to differentiate each other.
Even if the allegation come true and there is a full blown trial and conviction, it will still only amount to three sentences coverage on this article. < - > 3) You seem to be under the false impression that Biographies are required to separate personal life from business.
Anything that is relevant can be added to the appropriate sections in chronological order of which they occur. < - > I'm not at all opposed to adding important details of her personal life, but I am opposed to giving such information individual attention as it is not crucial to her career.

One more note - there are millions of people flocking to Wikipedia right now to get information, we should come to a general consensus on what has happened, and place a short line or two so people can get what they want. < - > Neither Rihanna, Brown, nor The LAPD have confirmed anything other than an ''alleged assault''.
And place a warning for information that is added that hasn't gone through the talk. < - > -
I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about ''the incident'' pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section.That said, I suppose since it's more about the charges against him, all that is mentioned there is more suitable for his article. < - > I think your personally feelings & fan relationship for Rihanna is getting in the way of how her article SHOULD be.
I agree that it's not big enough for its own section yet. < - > Controversial material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libellous.
There has been a push in BLPs to abstain from personal life sections and write biographies in chronological order in favor of WP:WEIGHT. < - > 1) I'm probably one of the most nuetral editors you'll ever meet.
Rihanna has been romantically connected to Shia LaBeouf, Josh Hartnett, Chris Brown, and even Jay-Z. < - > I think your personally feelings & fan relationship for Rihanna is getting in the way of how her article SHOULD be.
Either we make sure the truth stays, or there will be a ton of imbeciles filling in their two cents worth of ''she deserved it/hes an ass/etc'' comments. < - > I agree that it's not big enough for its own section yet.

Either we make sure the truth stays, or there will be a ton of imbeciles filling in their two cents worth of ''she deserved it/hes an ass/etc'' comments. < - > I don't see anyone arguing for non inclusion based on the fact that the incident was ''small''
Rihanna is very much alive and her privacy is the utmost concern. < - > If we, not being a primary source, have no information on whether this is verifiable, nor any information on a pending court date, then we have no business reporting it per WP:CRYSTAL BALL.
Just like wikipedia pages of Beyonce Knowles or even Marilyn Monroe. < - > Though it seems that on March 5, 2009, it's getting bigger, not dying down.
I don't see how any of my edits are contradictions. < - > Irrelevant aspects of her personal life do not need their own sections.
Your own post on the page is doing the exact opposite of what you have just quoted. < - > I do not feel that having a section about that, as long as it's well-sourced and well-worded (and appropriate), is unencyclopedic.
It is to support their ability to obtain the information and services needed to achieve their full human rights, safeguard their health and exercise their individual responsibilities in regard to sexual behavior and relationships, reproduction and family formation.''Also, there is reason to move Abortion Statistics and Other Data, given this editorial written by the site's owner. < - > I'm skeptical about listing them as biased when the other organizations there are clearly pushing one or the other agenda, whereas most of what AGI does is research.
I've moved it too, but I won't move it back until we have consensus. < - > Please refer to '' About Us:History.'' -
Please refer to '' About Us:History.'' - < - > On the other hand, a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA, nor that there has been since 1977, when ''the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent, not-for-profit organization''.
Although there was a connection at one time, that does not mean that the research put out by this institute currently is biased. < - > Or should we slot it into the second section along with AGI and Johnston's Archive?
The Institute itself does research in large part, and at least in that context it defines family planning broadly. < - > I'm satisfied with Severa's proposed compromise.--
Such images, in the context of the politically-charged Abortion article, would be more argumentative than informative — a violation of WP:NPOV. < - > Going back and forth like this is not going to solve anything.
You get it? < - > You must not be very well-versed in clinical abortion to make such odd statements about what an illustration of abortion would look like.
I'm saying that IF there are pictures like that, why can't Ros search for them? < - > The strong desire to keep images of what an abortion is hidden speaks volumes about those who possess it.
A shock photo, whether of the pro-life or pro-choice variety, would be unencylopaedic and POV. < - > Yes, the procedure isn't pretty, however neither is a cesarian section, or a pap smear, yet these are equally safe and commonplace surgeries or procedures.
Aborting a fetus is ugly, no mater how you slice her. < - > I think the issue is one of scale: the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life, a grassroots organization, while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women's Lives.
This shows that the pro-life movement has few supporters, which is not true. < - > If a picture that accurately represents an abortion - or perhaps one being performed (he does mention abortion procedures in his first post)- can actually be agreed upon by a majority as something worthwhile, I don't see a problem with it being added.
That would surely help to clarify the debate, educating people as to why there it is a controversial subject. < - > There is an image of an older pro-life crowd as well as Gloria Feldt and Rep.
Anyone object, and if so why? < - > But that is no reason to suppress the information (censor it).
Ros, feel free to post a suggested image here on the talk page. < - > Alienating language is not an effective manner by which to defend the article from POV images.

I have attempted to add the web site of The Aleister Crowley Society (of which I am the owner and editor) to the list of external links, as much as anything to provide balance to the frankly bizarre mix of existing links. < - > Editors become editors in no other way than deciding one day to edit Wikipedia; could you also make this section of your response a little more clear?So to recap, it seems like you need to explain how you're not running against WP:EL#ADV and WP:ELNO's #4, 10, and 11; if you can't get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here, perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia:Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed.

I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Certain species have remained static for millions of years.
Descent itself could arguably be blamed for a lot of things! < - > Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor (such as nucleotides, cell membrane, chirality of amino acids, genetic code); notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in 'all organisms in the exact same state (there are exeptions of course, but they are minor).

if your answer is yes, I await your edit to the page (as I see you have done much editing to it, and will leave it to you) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the ''Hamas'' page. < - > No doubt you will bring attention to the statement: ''...would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated'' ...in order to argue that U.S./israeli actions are ''necessary'' and achieve a (relatively) successful military goal and that, in turn, justify the actions making them allowable by the standards of the convention.

However, judging by the above, the Salon article is about Hamas and the ripost does belong in our WP article. < - > I've already addressed that argument, several times: Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was ''rejected'' in the Hezbollah case (it was not), it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance (different time, different place, different organization) is also the case in this instance.
