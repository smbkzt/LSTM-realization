@BryanBroaddus every single SUPERBOWL winner the past 5 years have been a big player in free agency and trades. It's just that they paid the right guys. You have to have all 3. Draft. Trades and or free agency. Cowboys only do 1.draft. Denver signed Ward Talib Manning Ware < - > @stsinaz @BryanBroaddus I agree Cowboys need to hit singles n Double in FA. Zack Brown be a Niice fit. Played last 2 years below 2.5mill per season. Great Player for the Price tag.
''People of African Origin'' would be ideal, however would tend to include all North Africans too. < - > I think the use of expression an expression like African, African-American or Afro-brazilians to be more appropriate in a formal setting. It carries more weight in formal setting that calling people black white red yellow brown, etc. It denotes better the ethnicity and the place of origin of the people in question.
i want to slap that bitch in the face and yell at him for being an unfeeling, killing, tyrant...i hate that mother fucker < - > yeah theres plenty i want to yell at him about.
An rfc is a cumbersome way to edit an article; particularly if you want to wait weeks for input by uninvolved editors (who almost by definition have little interest in the topic). < - > You are right!

The never happy brigade wanted Pellegrino out, but they also didn‚Äôt want Hughes in. They want us to spend bug money on foreign stars, but also want us to showcase our Academy players. The #saintsfc feed used to be so much more interactive and interesting. Now it‚Äôs whinge central. < - > @crstig Could not agree more... What we‚Äôve got with Sparky is exactly what we need at this time, now is the time for a backbone and determination!
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > I'll say it again, if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama's biography, I will not object at all.
@Se_Railway So many of your trains seem to have huge graffiti on the outside of the carriages at the moment. Looks horrible, such a shame. < - > @lil_ms_tina Yes I agree Tina, it might be recognised art in some circles but not on our trains; we do try to have them re painted ASAP. If you see any more Tweet us and we'll make sure it is logged. Have a good day. ^g
did he have authority to, etc (I am not endorsing any particular answers to those questions, just setting the scope of the subject matter), and secondly it is fairly specific to the US in that it is pretty much only in the US that anyone is saying it's not torture at all. < - > As far as I can make out, waterboarding is, in its terminological origin, a fairly recent specifically US (presumably US military) euphemism for a form of what anywhere else in time or space (including, incidentally, the UK) has been labeled water torture.

Britain appears to becoming a police state, whose function seems to be to suppress the thoughts, views and opinions of the indigenous British people over things they disagree with, whilst allowing those who hate them to have free rein. #DefendFreeSpeech < - > @mtavp I would challenge that, there is a balance between Free Speech, and the abuse of Free Speech, and that is what the law protects,we may not agree with what is said,that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs against the law  What is your definition of indigenous British people - genuine question
I am very convinced that getting up is a mistake but okay < - > @ShonaLeighPope Totally agree.
They have no place in the introduction. < - > Omitting the scandals is in keeping with the historical perspective encouraged by WP:LEAD.
MiLB is moving to a 15-second pitch clock (with bases empty, 20 seconds with a runner on) in AA and AAA this season. When they moved to a 15-second pitch clock in the Florida State League, reported pitcher DL stints increased. Could be reporting change, coincidence or real effect https://t.co/3zrrPu0C53 < - > @MLBPlayerAnalys Would agree that improper mechanics and arm fitness are probably the main causes, but having a pitch clock raises the odds of injuries for those high risk pitchers.
''To refrain from intoxicants which lead to loss of mindfulness (specifically, drugs and alcohol)'' This makes no sense since alcohol is a drug, albeit a legal one in most cultures. < - > Agreed, that makes more sense.
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > I think you're good with the honesty, but I agree with one of the posters above where sometimes it seems too confrontational and it could be taken too seriously.

However, I have a problem with this: ''profit is what is received, by virtue of control of the tools of production, by the capitalists'' This needs work since it is about ownership, not control. < - > I see your first point, although there is an important connection between capital ownership and enterprise control needs to be underlined, i.e. that in a capitalist system, it is shareholders, and not managers, that ''control'' the direction of an enterprise. And it is by virtue of that control that capital-owners are the residual earners (i.e. claim the firm's profits, as opposed to just being paid some fixed ''rent'' by the entrepreneur for the use of their capital).
I agree with your comments, < - > Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history, would be more appropriate, avoiding the problems of politics, over-attention to recent history (there are three images related to recent wars involving America, any more than one is too many) and preferably not so gruesome.
I nominate @HazOsterfield to play the role of Harry Osborn! ‚úãüòÇ https://t.co/RgQI7Rn6nK < - > @lindsaymabini @HazOsterfield AGREE!!! IT WOULD BE SO EPIC IF HE WAS HARRY (i mean he's alrdy a 'harry', so might as well give the role to him üòÇüòÖ jk)

Just because I like dogs, doesn't mean I HAVE to get a dog, or if I see a motivational quote I like, it doesn't mean I HAVE to live by it, I just agree with the thought of it.
We could say the only ''indigenous non-IE language'', at least for W Europe. < - > Yes, either of those would be better than 'pre-Indo-European'.

#thedrum Dutton is clearly determining for himself which refugees are deserving of resettlement in Australia. He has decided that white South African farmers have a stronger case than others whose skin colour is darker. < - > @tassiedevil Sad but true is that majority Australia agrees with him. One can see that inherent racism in their treatment of Indigenous ppl. They don't speak but they agree to keep ppl out and the ALP is exactly the same as LNP
If I were an education journo, I would be very interested to find out how institutions who have seen their external examiners resign in droves plan to assess and issue their degrees. Do they have time to recruit and hire replacements? https://t.co/cGZ6jUk94z < - > @earlymodernjohn @DrSKBarker Since finding externals and getting them to agree is itself a fundamentally collegiate and departmental thing, my gut says not a snowflake's chance in hell. And it is this kind of enduring protest or withdrawal of goodwill labor that is going to tip the scale I hope.
Um, I can't say I know what vandals you are referring to - but I can't help but notice that this article seems heavily censored. < - > It does seem heavily censored.
I love Rodrigo (: < - > Yes!
By your reasoning, rebellion/attacks on civilians is a crime too and some other contributor would justify the genocide on those grounds. < - > Yes, generally extermination is not considered a valid response to 'rebellion', particularly when evidence of said rebellion is quite elusive.
You are very confused about evolution. < - > I suppose I am confused, then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are, one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity?
While slavery was a horrible thing, we cant just act like it never happened. < - > yes, at every point.
"I'm not a very partisan person, even though I'm the leader of the Green Party." @ElizabethMay says the evidence used in federal approval of the Kinder Morgan Pipeline expansion was shoddy. https://t.co/94vof342Rn < - > @CBCEarlyEdition @ElizabethMay Ha...Elizabeth May is as partisan as any other MP and she discounts the KM approval process only because she doesn't agree with the result.

The truth of the matter is... no matter how many times you do a walk out of school to fight against something, you're not changing anything.. no matter what you think. Gun violence will never stop no matter how much you'll want it too. School shootings will continue to happen.... < - > And banning weapons won't stop anything either, anyone can learn metal working to create their own, just look at Brazil. You'll never be able to get rid of guns, and while I do agree there should be more extensive background checks, it's impossible to determine if someone could..
Instead of that, we need to convey the idea that Guernica was the first case of the mass bombing of the civilian city. < - > Those are good points Paul.
Come on @RandPaul !!! How can you say that "there was glee in her voice (Gina Haspel) when I read the book about her references to treatment of prisoner during waterboarding", like you can tell glee in someone's voice by reading their words in a book... @HARRISFAULKNER < - > Shows yu're judging her for carrying out her duties by claiming something you KNOW YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF! You can't sense glee in someone's demeanor from words in a book! You don't think you have completed some "Republican senators" missions that we don't agree with? COME ON MAN!
It seems like in the article we should say the work was done at NBS with a footnote indicating that the name was later changed to NIST. < - > Yes, we should say ''U.S. National Bureau of Standards (which later became NIST)'' ‚Äì no need for yet another footnote if it's only a short thing we can put in parentheses.
Question 1 probably should be amended to state that Obama was factually wrong when he stated that he went to a Muslim school. < - > From following the links, it becomes obvious that Obama mis-identified his 4th-grade school as being a Muslim school, when it is a secular school at which he did read the Koran (and make faces while doing so....) One year of taking a class on the Koran at the age of 10 is far different than attending a school dedicated to Islam.

Proganda. < - > You're damn right it was.
I have objections to the use of the phrase. For one, I am not sure what it is supposed to mean. It seems to imply that reality has a ''nature'' (i.e. it is God, it is a bunch of particles), which the Buddha never said. He only talked about how things function as relates to suffering, not what they really are, which is not a fruitful avenue to explore as regards nirvana. < - > I think the phrase should just be removed from the article, because it strikes me as a Western philosophical projection onto Eastern philosophy. it's just going to cause more confusion than it resolves.

It‚Äôs a big problem that people track crypto prices in USD. It strengthens USD.  Privacy and fungibility are important, but we also need a new stable crypto-derivative unit of account to decouple from the old system. < - > @HeyRhett I agree with you, this is a question that I only asked the other night, we should find another unit of reference to overcome all this based on criteria of stability, the common people will not accept the crypto altogether because of the oscillations.

Respected historian Antony Beevor says ''According to the Basque government, approximately a third of the town's population were casualties ‚Äì 1,654 killed and 889 wounded, although more recent research indicates that no more than between 200 and 300 died.''

News flash: Married couples tend to share the same beliefs and values. https://t.co/JWp6d1yM21 < - > @DavidAFrench @EvansKevans55 Sometimes. But also women of a certain age defer to men. I have a friend in her late 60's who NEVER spews the stuff her husband does and doesn't agree with him but ALWAYS says, "He studies this stuff more than me so he tells me how to vote."
To my mind, the whole sentence is silly: ''The USSR joined the Allies and the largest land theatre of war in history began, which, from this moment on, would tied down the major part of the Axis military power'' - this implies that the conflict on the eastern front didn't begin until the USSR joined the Allies (eg, that it started the war with Germany), which contradicts the previous sentence which gets the chronology right. < - > I recognised that it was a bit of a simplification but the previous version of the intro, frankly, did not clarify that the German-USSR front was part of the wider war.

I beg to differ bro. Law is continuously developing so being a lawyer, what you have learned in law school might not the same in 5, 10 years time.

Living in California my entire life, the people that bring the food that you eat are targeted and made to feel afraid all the time. This is not new. They contribute so much, sometimes being poisoned.

The nation is watching! < - > @sardesairajdeep What to do?Do not you agree?Or must you see video recording of the opposition?Don‚Äôt you really know, how Rahul &amp; Yechury &amp; their group will scuttle all attempts to discuss?Now is Rajdeep not pretending?Illogically &amp; unreasonably thwarting all growth in India. BJP  is development.
Sick of this narrative that men stalk and kill women for merely being rejected. Their were 117 cases like this last year. Their are 250 cases of mothers killing their children yearly. So according to y‚Äôall logic, men shouldn‚Äôt have kids with a woman, cuz they will kill it. < - > @ImStillRealAF @_Rian_Stone True. I agree. To complete your point, how many men kill their children annually? If it is less than 250, then we have a bullet proof case...
wow that was intense! < - > it came out soooo good!
Sen. Bernie Sanders criticizes the Pentagon for "excessive" and "obscene" compensation to the nation's largest defense contractors.   "What kind of message does it send when a defense contractor is paid 100 times more than the Secretary of Defense?" https://t.co/uaWStpCBB1 https://t.co/5TL6s1pwvJ < - > @ABC Don't worry Bernie....when a Dem wins the White House again, they can slash the budget for defence and ensure there are bi-partisan panels who agree all contracts over $1mill.
Cruz because I want Beto to win that badly.  Also, if Dems win the House, Ryan will lose his speakership and go down as one of the most pathetic individuals to ever hold the gavel. So that will bring me joy. Ryan losing his seat would be icing on the cake. https://t.co/UXI6gcJOTR < - > @jonfavs Totally agree with @jonfavs. Cruz followed by Ryan. After PA-18, with more than 100 districts considered tougher for the GOP to hold, we may be on track for a veto-proof House.

But at least as a ''List of pseudosciences'' using WP:PSCI, it will be the exact same grey which we deal with at Category:Pseudoscience and on the individual article level - articles for those topics which reside in the grey amongst pseudo-, proto-, and fringe science. < - > I fully support that.
For real friends, this should be obvious: At a time of fake news spreading, meddling in our elections, and attacks on people on our soil with nerve agent, the response must not be transatlantic bickering but transatlantic unity. < - > @eucopresident @MattMurph24 Agree, Tusk I think that most Europeans do. But we need responsible leaders on the other side of the pond to agree. In actions, words, and tweets.

''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide? < - > I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians.

Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here, it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
Just merging the Topics text up to the lead and promoting its subheadings would also work, as I am not sure what heading would be appropriate; and Idiosyncratic ideas should probably be sorted and merged up, anyway. < - > That sounds like an intriguingly nice way to simplify the levels we're using.

(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV. < - > It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. Viewing Religions as Dangerous.

It‚Äôs a shame when teachers feel wrapped up in being judged and judging others. Best thing about my school is feeling independent, autonomous and trusted.

There's so much bad writing about Indian food. Typical but completely made-up example: "I sit amid sandalwood-scented hammocks of my mind, entranced by drops of sunset-hued saffron".

Just finished my second @AdamLGNevill novel The Last Days.... what a climax, what a ride!

Love the setting as it's fairly local to me and I laughed on the bus yesterday at "Thin Len" - I'm not sure why I found it funny as it's a creepy book. Agree though - Last Days is bloomin' top stuff - my favourite horror novel.
I thus suggest that we create a second disclaimer, such as, ''The following statistical resources may be created by those with a non-neutral position in the abortion debate.''

The lead paragraph to this article misses the fundamental defining criterion of capitalism: that production is structured around the accumulation of capital - investment in order to realize a financial profit and reinvestment of that profit in production. The lead paragraph places undue weight on one aspect of capitalism, namely distribution of income (in a manner intended to glorify the system). < - > I think the lead needs to highlight things that make capitalism distinctive, e.g. what makes the last couple of hundred years of economic growth different from any two hundred year period of Roman history or Chinese history. I think one difference is that capitalism grows through the intensification of production (phrase this however you want) and this occurs because a significant portion of profits is invested in new technologies (as opposed to more slaves or more land). So I agree with Battlecry.

(HINT: Run center-left candidates who speak respectfully to a wide group of voters, who are not purity-tested out of a primary, and have a platform besides TRUMP IS TOTALLY HITLER.) < - > @RadioFreeTom Totally agree Tom.  Both parties should run moderate candidates. That‚Äôs how we will fix America. We have got to get rid of extremists. Period.
oh my it's so cute. < - > thats too cute.
Important 'current issues' are important to this article. < - > I agree that the article needs more on the Church throughout the world, but in a much broader way than has been proposed here - mission work, for example.
Sorry, just a very enthusiastic reaction to linguistic accuracy. < - > When used correctly, words are neat!

I am opposing using pictures of blood, cut limbs, resected bowels, resected pancreas etc in any article here. < - > We agree on the same thing, I'm opposed to having pictures that are unhelpful as well.
How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''. < - > I would agree.

Someone might say the same thing towards a picture of an alley in Calcutta of dying and starving children due to overpopulation, yet this is an appeal to emotion rather than a representation of information relevant to the article. < - > Shock images, whether ''pro-life'' or ''pro-choice,'' serve little to no informative purpose.
Our first heading is quite long, and against our MOS, it contains most of the title of the article:I suggest we shorten it to ''Topics''. < - > Not ideal either, but better, and I can't think of a better way to solve the problem.

There's plenty of evidence that HIV causes AIDS. < - > Your claim that ''there is no empirical evidence that HIV causes AIDS'' is simply untrue.
Suicide bombing of buses is a terrorist act, and there's no dispute that Hamas is doing that - meaning that Hamas employs terrorist tactics. < - > Hamas did bomb civilian targets, which is a terrorist tactic.
Labour MP tells @BethRigby they have zero confidence in Jeremy Corbyn over national security. In which case they have an obligation to resign the Labour-whip. National security is the primary responsibility of any government or opposition. < - > @DPJHodges @BethRigby Cannot believe I would ever agree with #HorridHodges  but Lab MPs who accuse Jeremy Corbyn of putting UK security at risk have DUTY to RESIGN. That it is clearly Tory Govt who are risking global security just like Blair and WMD myth. We know what a catastrophe that caused.
Yes, I agree. < - > Ditto.

I have no issue with VA secretary shulkin being an Obama holdover, other than the fact that he's treating our great veterans like an Obama holdover would treat them, our veterans deserve better! < - > @StephenMilIer @FussellEvelyn AGREE! THIS COUNTRY HAS HYSTORICALLY SWEPT OUR VETERANS' NEEDS UNDER THE RUG SINCE WW1.

In support of the above, I would like to note that the current text is clearly inaccurate and could almost be interpreted as a justification of the bombing, as it seems to imply that the bombing of Guernica was a military operation, and that ''propaganda'' figures were used to magnify the event. < - > Right now this part of the article is grossly misleading.

''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > The sentence at the top is close to the reworking that I gave the earlier sentence, and I agree that it can be improved.
Maybe I've been reading too many superhero comics, where heroic characters often are aliens/clones/alien clones/research projects/robots/all of the above, but I appear to have a much broader definition of ''person'' than Sa√Øx or, for that matter, DiZ, whom I didn't get to beat up, which continues to depress. < - > :(  He and DiZ dehumanize what they plan to take advantage of.

An important milestone has presently been announced in that the Vatican now concedes that Islam has overtaken it in size according to 2006 figures. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.

However, I can understand their motivations, in that they are wishing to ''humanize'' and ''personalize'', abortion, and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images. < - > I also agree that too many people are out to use the article to score political points, not to create an encyclopedia.

According to some, it's always management's fault, no matter what. Like, it's GM's fault if Benn doesn't play like last year. Same for Alzner if he doesn't play like he did in Wash. Ditto for Shlemko. It's also their fault for all the injuries or that players are lazy or dumb. < - > @JJonesey Alzner was already showing signs that he had declined, which is part of the reason he fell down the depth chart in Washington. Agree with the rest though.

Why not instead, get together with all of your asshole classmates &amp; like-minded automatons, and agree to stop being assholes and shooting one another? Too hard?
Certainly appears to be about the TPM, here are some excerpts: And with anti-pork Tea Partiers loose in Washington and deficit cutting in the air, it‚Äôs not as politically inconceivable as you might think. < - > I think you are right.
It would be obfuscating consensus to replace them with other words because thats not what is used. < - > I agree it would be ''obfuscating'' to turn the heading of AIDS Denialism into something like ''Alternative Theories'' but I also think it is obfuscating to lump all skeptical scientists together when they clearly do not share the same beliefs about HIV's role.
The fact some many ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù in America think #Trump‚Äôs a man of God just goes to show how spiritually deprived the American #church truly is. Donald Trump is one of the sickest men alive and has raped HUNDREDS of little kids. He is also a murderer. And yes, God loves him. < - > @RogueRothschild I agree with you on all of this but I'm comparing Trump to the Anti-Christ and the behavior is uncanny or better way to put it Trump and his lemmings are the human embodiment of Satan running amok for a season

This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''. This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > Yes, that's much better and I think rather unambiguous.
The clothing district was probably the most challenging out of all of them. < - > And yet, the one that seemed the most fun.
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump You mean like selling our foreign, national security and trade policy to the highest foreign bidder?  I agree.
It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like, ''Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31, 2010 [45]. < - > While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.

I would favour wording along the lines of¬†: Broadly speaking atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities (gods), most simply expressed as the position that there are no deities, or the explicit rejection of belief in deities. Atheism contrasts with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists. This article explains a range of prominent philosophical and religious positions on atheism, and traces a history of thought on atheism to contemporary debates and factors, including those about morality, social dynamics, and demographics. < - > Peterstrempel, I really like your suggested substitute.

It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense. < - > So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good, I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede, even if only a very minimal mention, so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits.

A more accurate word to describe the process that you (and yes others) ascribe as deportation is in fact forced (death) marches - after rounding up and uprooting people from their homes (and mostly after the males in the population had already been removed and dealt with by other means (primarily direct massacre). < - > I agree that the term used be ''forced (death) marches'', for infact that is exactly what was used by the Ottoman Empire.

The snapshot of the arguments has been presented by the proposer of the RfC in a simplified and misleading way to the extent that the well was poisoned. This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. I propose that editors who have been contributing to this page work together to find an alternative way to reach consensus. < - > Comment - I agree that the wording of the RFC was innapropriate and inclined towards yielding a hostile response. It failed to present the reason why the criticisms are notable despite the fact that they are only available for scrutiny in what are determined to be 'fringe sources', and that some of the critics (Eysenck and Ertel) are not astrology-sympathisers but offered independent assesments of the study whilst holding positions of academic authority outside of astrological circles.

This really saddens me. There is something so nostalgic about running through the aisles of #ToysRUs and I‚Äôm sad that my own kids will never have that. I know things evolve but there is something to be said about the good ole days. You will be missed ToysRus < - > @keenastar I agree.  But, the truth is Toys R Us has never been the same, definitely a far cry from what we grew up with.  They just cannot compete.  And, honestly for being solely a toy store, they‚Äôre inventory is always the worst.  I‚Äôm a Star Wars collector, I know.

The opening sentence was worded as follows ''In classical mechanics, when an object is observed from a reference frame that is rotating about a fixed axis, the motion of the object can be determined from Newton's laws by introduction of fictitious forces...''

In so far as the acceleration associated with them is in every way real, the discussion (which sometimes arises) about the reality of inertial forces themselves must be considered as aimless.

I just read something I agree with-much as I‚Äôve enjoyed Regina Mills and many other aspects of #OnceUponATime, one of the biggest problems was the studio and writers giving fans of couples whatever they wanted. It handcuffed storylines and characters terribly &amp; the show suffered. < - > @mockingbird2424 Yeah I agree. I think season 5 was the worst of them all. It became all about couples and they killed robin off but at least we got the EQ back but that wasn't long and then it went down hill again and then as much as I like them it became all about CS in the end.

I would favour wording along the lines of¬†: Broadly speaking atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities (gods), most simply expressed as the position that there are no deities, or the explicit rejection of belief in deities. Atheism contrasts with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists. This article explains a range of prominent philosophical and religious positions on atheism, and traces a history of thought on atheism to contemporary debates and factors, including those about morality, social dynamics, and demographics. < - > Peter, your proposed introduction looks just fine to me, with one proviso.
Few pre-game thoughts. Lineup is gonna be interesting tonight. If Iniesta is fit to start, I doubt Dembele will. I'd prefer him over Paulinho though, but I think Valverde thinks of him as a bigger risk. < - > I'm not sure how much I agree with that, because Paulinho too has shown that he's prone to losing the ball, and more importantly, adds little to creative parts of the game. We'll know soon enough though.

The quote would be more at home in our 'since 1900' section. < - > Any failures of mine notwithstanding, I'd be OK with moving the quote there, after the paragraph that mentions Harris and the other New Atheists. It would have the beneficial effect of removing recentism from the Etymology section.

Before going into details about the use of fictional force, it is essential that when typing in ''centrifugal force'' Wikipedia users do not come upon an article that suggests that it can only mean a fictitious force (''rotating reference frame'' is ambiguous for this issue, since mapped rotating reference frames are also used in Newtonian mechanics, without any fictitious force). < - > I agree that this article should not state or imply that the only meaning of ''centrifugal force'' is the ''fictitous force in rotating frames'' meaning, not that that is the only context (within classical mechanics) in which the term ''centrifugal force'' is used.

I think this is a fine proposal. < - > How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''.

''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > The sentence at the top is close to the reworking that I gave the earlier sentence, and I agree that it can be improved.

Realistically, a gun control plan that has any hope of getting us down to European levels of violence means confiscating guns. https://t.co/nirOebrPEz < - > @voxdotcom Realistically? Hahaha.

(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV. < - > User:DoctorEric, I agree with your assessment. Having a section on the ''Dangers of religions'' within an encyclopedia article seems as if the article is being written to push a particular point of view.
If your S/O truly cares about you, as mine does, they‚Äôll find everything they‚Äôre looking for in their relationship with you.

I think many (MAYBE most) writers would prefer the former be a function of the latter rather than an expense of it.

Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes'' 1 he has signed in to law a tax on tanning, as well as buying cigarettes (which are bought overwhelmingly by people making less than 250,000) 2 These facts should be mentioned, I think, because they have caused some controversy among his opponents, and some supporters alike.Long story short: We'll know he raised taxes on under $250,000s if and only if a reliable source says he did. < - > During his campaign, Obama had pledged that ''no family making less than $250,000.00 a year will see any form of tax increase.'' This was violated though when he raised the cigarette tax by 156% in April 2009, a tax that effects people below the poverty line.

How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...''

So here is the dilemma: if the standard usage of centrifugal force is used, as in the present article, the result is an article consonant with the vast majority of the literature and with the common use of ''centrifugal force''. If instead the formulation is used, then (i) immediately one has to make the subject more abstract to get across the idea of generalized coordinates, and (ii) immediately one has to issue a disclaimer that this viewpoint is not what is commonly understood by centrifugal force. < - > Apart of that, as Frugal correctly states here below, a discussion of fictitious forces certainly doesn't address my objections to the current article as stated at the outset, as it is a wrong intro for people who type ''centrifugal force''.

On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths). < - > Shlomi's right that the earth won't overheat so long as it can continue to radiate in infrared into space, but there are mechanisms for trapping heat on earth - the greenhouse effect is the major one, and in our case, the biosphere is another obvious one.

Think about it. We required the Federal government to enforce businesses serving Black customers. Why? Because businesses almost universally refused Black Americans service. They had nowhere to go. No options.  That is what this is. Arbitrary banning of a singular group. < - > From a libertarian point of view the government had no business telling businesses who they could serve. In theory, I agree. But it became such an oppressive standard no other option was available.  That is where we are right now.

I agree with the micro influencer data, that the model with the real interactions is considered the "it" girl because followers crave real interaction.
Students are walking out of their schools in a nationwide demonstration over gun violence. The protests are set to begin at 10 am in local time zones. https://t.co/t7QsDSpRFV < - > @nytimes I agree with them. We should do whatever it takes to keep kids safe. We need to give the government 24/7 access to everyone‚Äôs phones, computers, etc. Think of all the crime it would stop!

Regardless of your feelings towards the game or who's involved.  Tonight, Ninja, Drake, Juju Smith and Travis Scott just set the next milestone in the industry.  Combining global stars in a FTP BR Game on Twitch.

Lawmaker's tweet after physicist Stephen Hawking's death draws criticism https://t.co/DYdgUrMugz < - > @FoxNews I agree.
He'll be 30 come the start of next season, but Willian has enough God-given ability to stand him in good stead for another couple of years &amp; he loves playing for Chelsea. That's a cocktail we Blues supporters love. First priority to keep hold of this summer imo. https://t.co/46HcPxnvol < - > @gate17marco I'd agree mate, Hazard too. People can coat him off over last night but when he's a very good player, difference is Messi is an amazing player. Most players look insignificant when sharing a pitch with him.
The problem in Wajir is a national one not just for that county.  #WajirNiKenya #WajirNiKenya #WajirNiKenya #WajirNiKenya https://t.co/l23dHj7yxN < - > @Aabubakar382 Then the leaders must listen to the concerns of the non-local teachers. Embrace them, protect them, as you build capacity to take up these positions. I agree it is a national issue with help from the local community, it can be addressed.

1% may be accurate over all of the Inquisitions, but I think this will need to be made more clear, since the previous sentences detail the Spanish Inquisition.I disagree with the change also, I left a note on Xandars page. < - > And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we're talking about.

If you believe the account of Adam in Genesis is metaphorical, how would Jesus have direct lineage from a metaphorical person? < - > @carobini Not that I agree with this, but wouldn't they say that all humans have a common ancestor?
As it stands, I would accept ''the regularity of his initiations with the United Grand Lodge of England has been disputed by some'' as a safely NPOV compromise. < - > I agree that there is a problem and I thank you for pointing this out.
The more accurate way to describe this would be to say that Theravada is the most conservative surviving branch of Buddhism: it is equally old, but it has changed less over time.‚Äî < - > I agree with some of Greg's sentiments about the ambiguity of the claim of Theravada being the earliest. It is probably the most conservative in its approach, but in some sense all branches of Buddhism are ultimately equally old, because they all have their roots in the very earliest Buddhism of India.
I'd suggest replacing ''Dangers of Religion'' with something along the lines of ''Atheists' Criticism of Religion'' and then appending a similarly brief subsection titled something like'' Religious Response to Atheists' Criticism''. These are somewhat unwieldy headings but this does seem to be what is being discussed. < - > @JJL - I think your suggested titles are better than any suggested so far (including what I had in mind).
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > Ditto Xandar.

Received complaints of Class 12 CBSE Accountancy paper being leaked.Asked officers of Directorate of Education to investigate&amp;lodge complaint with CBSE: @msisodia, Delhi Education Minister and Deputy CM < - > @timesofindia @msisodia They donot agree to remove additional subjects because the private schools want to earn profit by making students forcefully take up additional subjects such as physical education, fine arts, Foundation of information technology etc. I have also suffered of this kind of case.

It improves on the existing version because ''Armenian Genocide'' does NOT refer to deporting and massacring - those are methods - it refers to the aim and the end result, the aim/result being the destruction of the Ottoman Empires Armenian population. < - > So I very much agree with the intent of your change - diferentiating the methods of genocide from the thing itself - my caution (and yes objection) is relying on the term ''deportation''.

This article currently attempts to be an ethnological article while using a title that is supremely unsuitable. The asian people article actually covers all the ethnic groups in the continent, rather than just a ''colour'' group. I think the White people article too should be moved to ''Caucasian'', since the current terminology is unscientific and originates more in pseudo-scientific racist circles than anywhere else. The linking of Africans and melanesians might be acceptable in an article describing English language usage, but not in an article describing the ethnic groups originating in sub-saharan Africa. < - > I agree with both comments for the most part.

What's good for the goose is good for the gander. When teams stop asking for pay cuts &amp; releasing those that refuse, then players can stop asking for more money when outperforming contracts. Telling me that's false equivalency will fall on deaf ears. https://t.co/UIzD3R03Cf < - > @corryjoel A contract is in place and it should be honored it is what you agree to and it's binding.   Teams cutting players by attempting to force a players and for a pay cut is wrong (morally) as they can just buy them out.   This scenario justifies Gronks action, which is sad.
It might be trivial but I think that the sentence ''The manner of death was certified as ''undetermined''.'' needs citation. < - > Agreed.

TV networks are looking for the next Romo. They will foolishly only direct their search at former QB.s  They should instead hire Joe Thomas.

In a crucial moment she decided to use that victimization for political gain. That showed us something about her nature as well. I agree that her rape didn‚Äôt define her or my opinions abt her

How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today.

It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense. < - > So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good, I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede, even if only a very minimal mention, so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits.

How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''. < - > Support: We are not here to adopt doublespeak and newspeak, even when advanced by the US.
Regardless of my opinion of the tastelessness of this image it is definitely in the wrong place. < - > I agree that it does not add anything to the article.
RTD has some serious explaining to do because part one was one big clusterfuck of story lines. < - > Yeah, I don't know.
We assert facts here, even fact about opinions, but we do not assert an opinion as fact, which is what an OpEd is. < - > We don't call it a criticism or a controversy, it is simply an event that happened.
British English, hence British flag. < - > Then we are in agreement. Adding the template with the UK flag is a bunch of editors trying to make a point. It it unnecessarily provocative.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > The ''Modern challenges faced by the church'' phrasing is good.
But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan, Letterman, Ferguson, or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now. < - > Agreed one thousand percent.
I respect Stephen Hawking as a great physicist, but he was a hypocrite.   He was an Israel boycotter who contributed to an anti-Semitic movement that demeaned academia. On the top of that, the chip in the device that allowed him to speak was developed in Israel. #StephenHawking https://t.co/2SFiH5Cm5K < - > @HananyaNaftali @tpel78 Agree strongly. Like many geniuses, he was not a very nice person in many ways. His advocacy of BDS was inexcusable. I remember him for his incomparable contribution to physics. This is what defined him.

If Trump was a dictator all of his opposition Left would be imprisoned already! And I say good ridens! It‚Äôs long overdue for real Americans to turn their wrath on the democrats and declare WAR on these traitors.

I'd say that makes it very very clear what the article is on about and what states exist on it.
Looking ahead to the semi final we have two options. The first would be to stick with 4-2-3-1 which clearly offers us more attacking options or we play 4-3-3/4-5-1 which means one of Windass, Candeias or Murphy will drop out for the extra central midfield player. < - > @SpatestonBear2 Totally agree Willy, I‚Äôd go for a 4-3-3 bringing Dorrans/Holt in for Windass, hopefully with a fit Wallace &amp; McCrorie to add a bit more physicality. We‚Äôd also have a strong bench to freshen things up after 60/70 mins of high pressing

One reason so many folks want to put Xi in context of "a new Mao" or "a new emperor," is that it is easier to understand things in terms of (reasonably) familiar past paradigms than to face the possibility that what is happening is something new which we do not yet understand. < - > @JeremiahJenne @MariaRepnikova Agree. It also becomes a barrier to analysing not just what is happening under Xi, but also why these new trajectories are emerging. Too much denunciation, to point where it prevents attempts to form understandings of where China is going, how will change.

So that study that is going around that there is "little" change between preprint and final published manuscripts. Lots of folks saying it's proof publishers don't add value. My Qs: What's the comparison? How much change would = value? Is it just volume of change not quality? < - > @lisalibrarian I agree that this kind of value cannot really be measured. Sometimes just a comma makes a world's difference in meaning. Instead, what we should do is look at publisher behavior to estimate the value they themselves put on their work.
