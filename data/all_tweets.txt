high quality sourcing is available on this topic so wpparity doesnt apply and per wpdue including a paragraph from fringe astrological journals in equal size to our summary of nature is inappropriate < - > you are right in the sense that astrologers disagree with carlsons conclusions though that statement invites the comment they would wouldnt they the case for the criticisms of carlson is stronger than that if you follow the threads you will see that in this instance two of the psychology professors eysenck and ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write scientists disagree or psychologists disagree

few things harm churches ministries or businesses more than the preservation of artificial harmony no dissent allowed no conflict allowed no differing views allowed that is not unity its a poor substitute which weakens the team < - > you can disagree without rudeness yet we are often accused of hatred for pointing out bible truth it takes more love amp guys to speak truth in love than yo fake unity when you know someone or some group in grave error opposition to scriptural truth
