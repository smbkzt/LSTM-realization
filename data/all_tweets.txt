Every United signing since Ferguson retired rated by @JamesRobsonMEN, who does do halves #mufc https://t.co/d0NV2uHjEE < - > @samuelluckhurst @JamesRobsonMEN Pogba,fellaini -5 n lukaku-8.Others I agree with @JamesRobsonMEN
Longest 15 seconds of my life! < - > And trippy!
What grape must feature on a modern by the glass list...? < - > @tomhigham28 I think it deoends on the bravery of the venue. I'd agree with @AndyTheWineGuy and say Grenache Blanc as there is so many good examples now at reasonable prices, consumers must try it!
@BryanBroaddus every single SUPERBOWL winner the past 5 years have been a big player in free agency and trades. It's just that they paid the right guys. You have to have all 3. Draft. Trades and or free agency. Cowboys only do 1.draft. Denver signed Ward Talib Manning Ware < - > @stsinaz @BryanBroaddus I agree Cowboys need to hit singles n Double in FA. Zack Brown be a Niice fit. Played last 2 years below 2.5mill per season. Great Player for the Price tag.
''People of African Origin'' would be ideal, however would tend to include all North Africans too. < - > I think the use of expression an expression like African, African-American or Afro-brazilians to be more appropriate in a formal setting. It carries more weight in formal setting that calling people black white red yellow brown, etc. It denotes better the ethnicity and the place of origin of the people in question.
i want to slap that bitch in the face and yell at him for being an unfeeling, killing, tyrant...i hate that mother fucker < - > yeah theres plenty i want to yell at him about.
An rfc is a cumbersome way to edit an article; particularly if you want to wait weeks for input by uninvolved editors (who almost by definition have little interest in the topic). < - > You are right!
Until then, it is better covered under Presidency of Barack Obama and BP. < - > I think the whole section should be deleted from this bio entirely and moved to Presidency, and would applaud consensus to do so.
Is Wikipedia even going to mention it, or at least that he went down to the Gulf to check on the spill's cleanup process? < - > I would not oppose an addition of an entry based on the oil spill.
No point snarking this, really, is there? < - > It's a (freakish, medieval) version of ''mistakes were made'' - it takes responsibility away from any actual person or group.
hurray! < - > woo hoo!
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > I'll say it again, if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama's biography, I will not object at all.
@Se_Railway So many of your trains seem to have huge graffiti on the outside of the carriages at the moment. Looks horrible, such a shame. < - > @lil_ms_tina Yes I agree Tina, it might be recognised art in some circles but not on our trains; we do try to have them re painted ASAP. If you see any more Tweet us and we'll make sure it is logged. Have a good day. ^g
did he have authority to, etc (I am not endorsing any particular answers to those questions, just setting the scope of the subject matter), and secondly it is fairly specific to the US in that it is pretty much only in the US that anyone is saying it's not torture at all. < - > As far as I can make out, waterboarding is, in its terminological origin, a fairly recent specifically US (presumably US military) euphemism for a form of what anywhere else in time or space (including, incidentally, the UK) has been labeled water torture.
I am very convinced that getting up is a mistake but okay < - > @ShonaLeighPope Totally agree.
They have no place in the introduction. < - > Omitting the scandals is in keeping with the historical perspective encouraged by WP:LEAD.
MiLB is moving to a 15-second pitch clock (with bases empty, 20 seconds with a runner on) in AA and AAA this season. When they moved to a 15-second pitch clock in the Florida State League, reported pitcher DL stints increased. Could be reporting change, coincidence or real effect https://t.co/3zrrPu0C53 < - > @MLBPlayerAnalys Would agree that improper mechanics and arm fitness are probably the main causes, but having a pitch clock raises the odds of injuries for those high risk pitchers.
''To refrain from intoxicants which lead to loss of mindfulness (specifically, drugs and alcohol)'' This makes no sense since alcohol is a drug, albeit a legal one in most cultures. < - > Agreed, that makes more sense.
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > I think you're good with the honesty, but I agree with one of the posters above where sometimes it seems too confrontational and it could be taken too seriously.
You are so beautiful! < - > Looks really good!
How do you feel about patio drinking, BECAUSE I FEEL GREAT ABOUT ITTTTT < - > i LOVE patio drinking.
However, I have a problem with this: ''profit is what is received, by virtue of control of the tools of production, by the capitalists'' This needs work since it is about ownership, not control. < - > I see your first point, although there is an important connection between capital ownership and enterprise control needs to be underlined, i.e. that in a capitalist system, it is shareholders, and not managers, that ''control'' the direction of an enterprise. And it is by virtue of that control that capital-owners are the residual earners (i.e. claim the firm's profits, as opposed to just being paid some fixed ''rent'' by the entrepreneur for the use of their capital).
I agree with your comments, < - > Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history, would be more appropriate, avoiding the problems of politics, over-attention to recent history (there are three images related to recent wars involving America, any more than one is too many) and preferably not so gruesome.
So are we on for the 7:30 show, then? < - > Yup!
We could say the only ''indigenous non-IE language'', at least for W Europe. < - > Yes, either of those would be better than 'pre-Indo-European'.
You don't really need someone to save you. < - > you can be strong, and sometimes you might have to be.
The latest of my Q&amp;A interviews for @F365 is with award-winning journalist @LindseyCBowers. She grew up in a West Ham-supporting family, saw QPR lose 6-0 at Nottingham Forest, confirms @susannareid100 is lovely &amp; insists @piersmorgan is a nice guy: https://t.co/BxxR9zdz4X < - > @SachinNakrani @susannareid100 @F365 @LindseyCBowers @piersmorgan Yes I agree Susanna lovely and Piers nice guy deep down. He cares I know. Can't agree with the teams though got to be Chelsea football.
Do you agree? https://t.co/gE4f2fRVlK < - > @marckasbo i agree but sometimes we must to do for the important together and polite not love
Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding. < - > I agree with User:Hypnosadist.
...I really should go see about getting into NKU and going into art history, shouldn't I. < - > I don't know you, but I second this comment!
This is a personal attack. < - > Agreed, Nancy, I apologize.
So cute!!! < - > handmade gifts are the best..
#thedrum Dutton is clearly determining for himself which refugees are deserving of resettlement in Australia. He has decided that white South African farmers have a stronger case than others whose skin colour is darker. < - > @tassiedevil Sad but true is that majority Australia agrees with him. One can see that inherent racism in their treatment of Indigenous ppl. They don't speak but they agree to keep ppl out and the ALP is exactly the same as LNP
If I were an education journo, I would be very interested to find out how institutions who have seen their external examiners resign in droves plan to assess and issue their degrees. Do they have time to recruit and hire replacements? https://t.co/cGZ6jUk94z < - > @earlymodernjohn @DrSKBarker Since finding externals and getting them to agree is itself a fundamentally collegiate and departmental thing, my gut says not a snowflake's chance in hell. And it is this kind of enduring protest or withdrawal of goodwill labor that is going to tip the scale I hope.
Um, I can't say I know what vandals you are referring to - but I can't help but notice that this article seems heavily censored. < - > It does seem heavily censored.
I love Rodrigo (: < - > Yes!
By your reasoning, rebellion/attacks on civilians is a crime too and some other contributor would justify the genocide on those grounds. < - > Yes, generally extermination is not considered a valid response to 'rebellion', particularly when evidence of said rebellion is quite elusive.
You are very confused about evolution. < - > I suppose I am confused, then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are, one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity?
While slavery was a horrible thing, we cant just act like it never happened. < - > yes, at every point.
"I'm not a very partisan person, even though I'm the leader of the Green Party." @ElizabethMay says the evidence used in federal approval of the Kinder Morgan Pipeline expansion was shoddy. https://t.co/94vof342Rn < - > @CBCEarlyEdition @ElizabethMay Ha...Elizabeth May is as partisan as any other MP and she discounts the KM approval process only because she doesn't agree with the result. Nomatter what evidence was brought forward she would oppose KM
My condolences on your loss. < - > I'm so sorry for your loss.
Giving details of every incident during his presidency is impossible. < - > Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now.
The truth of the matter is... no matter how many times you do a walk out of school to fight against something, you're not changing anything.. no matter what you think. Gun violence will never stop no matter how much you'll want it too. School shootings will continue to happen.... < - > And banning weapons won't stop anything either, anyone can learn metal working to create their own, just look at Brazil. You'll never be able to get rid of guns, and while I do agree there should be more extensive background checks, it's impossible to determine if someone could..
Instead of that, we need to convey the idea that Guernica was the first case of the mass bombing of the civilian city. < - > Those are good points Paul.
Come on @RandPaul !!! How can you say that "there was glee in her voice (Gina Haspel) when I read the book about her references to treatment of prisoner during waterboarding", like you can tell glee in someone's voice by reading their words in a book... @HARRISFAULKNER < - > Shows yu're judging her for carrying out her duties by claiming something you KNOW YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF! You can't sense glee in someone's demeanor from words in a book! You don't think you have completed some "Republican senators" missions that we don't agree with? COME ON MAN!
Question 1 probably should be amended to state that Obama was factually wrong when he stated that he went to a Muslim school. < - > From following the links, it becomes obvious that Obama mis-identified his 4th-grade school as being a Muslim school, when it is a secular school at which he did read the Koran (and make faces while doing so....) One year of taking a class on the Koran at the age of 10 is far different than attending a school dedicated to Islam.
Justin Gaethje: Forget about condition, one-handed Nick Newell deserves UFC shot https://t.co/oeuB2ptYKb https://t.co/ToHAHrd0Dl < - > @MMAjunkie Yes, I agree 100% with Justin Gaethje!
Besides he's fat and heavy and will taste good. < - > He should be!
I want them deleted and replaced with non sensitive photos, can I have a seconder. < - > Take down the statue of Lenin, then.
I think the whole section should be deleted from this bio entirely and moved to Presidency, and would applaud consensus to do so. < - > Okay, we can clean up a few things.
Proganda. < - > You're damn right it was.
I have objections to the use of the phrase. For one, I am not sure what it is supposed to mean. It seems to imply that reality has a ''nature'' (i.e. it is God, it is a bunch of particles), which the Buddha never said. He only talked about how things function as relates to suffering, not what they really are, which is not a fruitful avenue to explore as regards nirvana. < - > I think the phrase should just be removed from the article, because it strikes me as a Western philosophical projection onto Eastern philosophy. it's just going to cause more confusion than it resolves.
I think it's 2). < - > Therefore, my vote is on 2.
Also, Jack is going to be messed up after Children Of Earth. < - > Wonder what they're going to do with Jack.
Maybe flipping them around and seeing ''Sanjuro'' first is the way forward, then. < - > So are we on for the 7:30 show, then?
Nothing I can really say, my love to you both. < - > hugs for you both.
Is Workaholics actually funny? I don't trust some of my friends. < - > @Matt2Clapp Let me know, I usually agree with you.
I reviewed the new Ricky Gervais special. It's really bad! https://t.co/BX08JBKp4Q < - > @grmartin Thank you :) I couldn't agree more.
it really makes me mad < - > I know, it's irritating.
Support. < - > Support: seems like a reasonable compromise.
gorgeous layout! < - > i like the layout!!!
Oh no, I'm so sorry. < - > oh no :( i'm so sorry to hear that.
Either way, I think it was great of you to find these and make them more accessible to us for our consideration. < - > I agree.
Stephen Hawking inspired me before ALS - to keep asking questions, seeking answers, and understanding the cosmic perspective. But since ALS, he saved my life with his example - people diagnosed with ALS can continue to live productive &amp; purposeful lives for decades.  -SG < - > @TeamGleason @ALSTDI Agree. No point on concentrating things you cannot do. That list is infinitely long also for healthy people. As is the list of what you can do with just eyes.
Speaking of cleaning, I was watching one of my favorite BBC shows today (''How Clean is Your House?'') and happened to see the most horrific flat I've seen in my life. < - > Wow, that was really horrifying.
Also, after you finish that Super Saiyan video, get ready for this. https://t.co/iDKTzNl9zp < - > @SethMPTP Oh, so we agree to a degree
What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture. < - > I agree with what Jehochman has said.
My sympathies and love are with you both. < - > Hugs to both of you...
Agreed. < - > I don't feel that the incident yet deserves its own section, and sectioning it off in such a way would just encourage further recentism and tabloidesque details.
Time will tell whether Obama is damaged by the spill. < - > It is difficult to see circumstances in which this matter will become significant enough to be a notable aspect of Obama's biography, although there are conceivably related articles in which this could be brought up.
I'm still confused by it all although John Simm in a dress made up for some of it. < - > He was working that dress.
This was my last gift to her, and I miss her already. < - > She knows you did it because you care.
It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. Viewing Religions as Dangerous. < - > Griswaldo has suggested ''Viewing religions as dangerous'' may be a better title, and I would agree.
I don't think it would suit me personally because of my colouring, but I thought the yellow one looked really fresh and pretty. < - > Pink and Yellow reminds me of lemonade *drool*
I mean, if you think of ''the Devil'' as ''the personification of evil, or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil'', and sex abuse is evil, and the coverup of evil is evil, and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican, then, well, yes, the Devil is at work inside the Vatican. < - > What he said.
i swear to god, the more and more that i learn the angrier i get. < - > Questioning Israeli actions isn't anti-semitic.

If the answer is ''No'', enjoy your logic bomb. < - > That logic takes my brain to interesting places~.
The health and welfare of dogs needs to be priority - dogs shouldn't be bred just for their appearance. All dogs should be able to breathe easily, enjoy running &amp; playing, and be free from pain #breedtobreathe #SavingtheBritishBulldog < - > @RSPCA_official Health &amp; Welfare 100% agree.  should be priority. But NO breed should be continuly bred when 1000's end up in Rescues/Pounds YES &amp; KC Reg ones.
Good luck! < - > Good luck on exams, and I hope you feel better soon!
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. < - > Oh how awful for you both.
the one drop rule; it was never a claim he made of himself, nor has it been corroborated by any serious historian. < - > Unless there is a reliable source confirming verifiable proof of what seems now to only be accusations, I don't see eeason to change this article.--
To whoever gets my liver when I die, I am totally ok if you have a couple of drinks. Seriously people need to get off their high horses. < - > @deemadigan I agree.  There's a huge difference between an occasional drink and drinking the bar dry.
News flash: Married couples tend to share the same beliefs and values. https://t.co/JWp6d1yM21 < - > @DavidAFrench @EvansKevans55 Sometimes. But also women of a certain age defer to men. I have a friend in her late 60's who NEVER spews the stuff her husband does and doesn't agree with him but ALWAYS says, "He studies this stuff more than me so he tells me how to vote."
To my mind, the whole sentence is silly: ''The USSR joined the Allies and the largest land theatre of war in history began, which, from this moment on, would tied down the major part of the Axis military power'' - this implies that the conflict on the eastern front didn't begin until the USSR joined the Allies (eg, that it started the war with Germany), which contradicts the previous sentence which gets the chronology right. < - > I recognised that it was a bit of a simplification but the previous version of the intro, frankly, did not clarify that the German-USSR front was part of the wider war.

I beg to differ bro. Law is continuously developing so being a lawyer, what you have learned in law school might not the same in 5, 10 years time. So, we also feel that our knowledge is insufficient and we have to keep chasing to ensure we are in line with the dynamic https://t.co/2bidYt5nsB < - > @anneieqa yeap i was corrected by one of my lawyer friends. i agree that i am wrong here. thinking about it, true tho, lawyers need to keep up with latest developments &amp; dynamics. even the law that i am using now pun being amended few times
Thoughts from someone way too far into the wine: if they kill off Cap in Infinity War, and don't have a scene of him meeting Peggy Carter for their last dance, I am going to be so pissed. Or devastated. Or both. < - > @GameOverRos Hmm ... I WOULD agree, but then how sad would it be when Infinity Wars II brought him back to life? Would we get another Buffy situation?
We took our country back. < - > I, and many other people, just did!
An unexpected observation from our #sxsw panel. Got more pushback talking about white supremacy here than I have in most other spaces. What's up with that? < - > @SikhProf Based on my admittedly little experience, SXSW remains a predominantly white and male event. Even the most thoughtful, fair person can become defensive when a group they are a part of, but do not necessarily agree with, is repeatedly criticized (justly or not).

my school in Alabama walked out. we stood up for ourselves...in the process our teachers mocked us, threatened us, and tried to silence us. one teacher started ARGUING with me.   BUT WE MUST NOT BACK DOWN  #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @ughh_erin Why "walk out" (with zero consequences), other than an appropriation of a "cause" to self-congratulate yourselves? Why not instead, get together with all of your asshole classmates &amp; like-minded automatons, and agree to stop being assholes and shooting one another? Too hard?
am happy about that < - > Everyone says it's stressful and awful, but I LOVE it.
Is that the same ire and frustration and outrage over ''UNFAIR ADVANTAGE'' re: Affirmative Action is hardly ever expressed or articulated when the children of rich, white donors seem to have little problem getting into the school of their choice. < - > That and a hell of a lot of his parents' money.
Obviously, Obama has received criticism for a number of his policies and activities in the last year, especially his push for health care legislation, his continuation of Bush's foreign policy, evinced by his decision to send additional troops into the field, and his unwillingness to close Gitmo, another Bush policy he's left unchanged. < - > I agree with OP.
Hugs to both of you. < - > oh no :( i'm so sorry to hear that.
There are numerous examples of entropy driving order and self assembly. < - > Well at its heart, all organization is driven by entropy; the trick is getting the entropy to work for organization, which biological organisms are very good at doing.
Is this a joke, Axios? They're calling for a meeting with the UN Security Council and sending it to NATO in Brussels to maybe trigger Art. V. WEAK?   https://t.co/Lro0YPx0tX < - > @ericgarland I do not understand your second sentence. I agree with the first sentence. "Maybe" trigger Article 5. OK got it. Article 5. &amp; NATO more powerful than UN because of Security Council composition &amp; UN failure to have much enforcement forces.
Living in California my entire life, the people that bring the food that you eat are targeted and made to feel afraid all the time. This is not new. They contribute so much, sometimes being poisoned. Tired of this idea that they are expendable. CA exploits them. < - > While I agree what they provide has nothing to do with their worth, people can't even appreciate how they feed all your asses. Such a beautiful and giving people.
I did notice that Pope image when I was trawling commons but I dismissed it as the subject (i.e. < - > I agree that the Pope image is completely unsuitable.

It's not quite correct to treat the Earth as a blackbody, since the atmosphere has a confounding effect - we might say that the Earth acts as a blackbody above the level of the atmosphere, but actually the amount of radiation emitted is inconsistent with the surface temperature of earth. < - > You are right, the earth is not really a blackbody.
Yes and it will stay that way until the pro-bush camp stop attacking the definition of waterboarding as torture. < - > Thank you.
Regardless of my opinion of the tastelessness of this image it is definitely in the wrong place. < - > The picture does not illustrate any specific point to advance the article.

Two sentences do not warrant an individual section. < - > Yeah, especially the whole thing's starting to die down a bit.
Trump has not explained to anyone why Tillerson was fired. This is the lack of transparency that creates distrust with the people. Americans deserve to know what is going on. #TillersonOut   https://t.co/6IMlirn16b < - > @PramilaJayapal it should be obvious... news stations said could not agree on best way to handle @StateDept ... besides other presidents have done same thing... stop the democrat which hunt and do what's best for WA and country...

The @realDonaldTrump Cabinet has been the most corrupt Cabinet in US history. We must not normalize this. https://t.co/4z61fNnXqJ < - > @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I agree, @tedlieu. You know what else we should not "normalize" giving everything @realDonaldTrump touches the superlative "most."  Jesus, how the hell do you know that? Did you look at every @Cabinet in our history?  The crime story writes itself, until @TheDemocrats step in.
But whether or not this view of the proper scope of this list is agreed to be an appropriate bound, I've removed Darwinism. < - > I currently support the removal of Darwinism (which isn't a well defined term anyway)
Otherwise, no comma should be next to those words. < - > One comma is wrong, and two commas would make it needlessly weak, so I vote for zero.
It breaks the mold of how you usually start the poems you post here, and I love it. < - > This is a lovely piece of poetry.

He said "yes." Larry Kudlow in next National Economic Council director replacing Gary Cohn. < - > @cvpayne What I don't get is why he didn't ask someone like you or your former colleague Eric Bolling charismatic knowledgeable business background  media personality who can sell his message I don't think Kudlow can sell his message. I may not always agree with u Charles but I respect u
I'm not saying what I wrote can't be improved upon, I'm saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter, if it then makes it lopsided, is not the answer here.And to Wikidemon's already beginning editing, regardless of the colloquial use of their former name, they are not actually called ''British Petroleum''. < - > Okay, we can clean up a few things.

We are in the habit of thinking that "political management" is a dirty word, but when you run a party-political camp for kids and young people, keeping them safe IS good political management. < - > @LewSOS "political management" to me means protecting the party. I agree this is important, but obviously if they'd been running the camps safely there wouldn't be a political management issue.
You heard it here first folks. The odds are 80-20% that @StormyDaniels will show up on tv for her interview with "librarian glasses" on to make her appear more "innocent".

I am tired of MMORPGs that try to make your player character out to be some great "Hero."  It's contrary to why even play MMOs to begin with.  We play single player RPGs to feel like a hero. We play MMORPGs to be a small part in something much greater. < - > @VioletZer0 I agree with @zakn if you ignore the tutorial silliness Eve is a place where you are what you become in the game.

Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.'' Have at it! < - > (ec) I l do ike the idea of starting that sentence with ''Today, ...'' That does help frame the historical context well, implying current, but perhaps transient, notability.
Go Italy https://t.co/wLalyHtKrJ < - > @Arron_banks Go Go Matteo can't wait to agree a trade deal with you
wow that was intense! < - > it came out soooo good!
Sen. Bernie Sanders criticizes the Pentagon for "excessive" and "obscene" compensation to the nation's largest defense contractors.   "What kind of message does it send when a defense contractor is paid 100 times more than the Secretary of Defense?" https://t.co/uaWStpCBB1 https://t.co/5TL6s1pwvJ < - > @ABC Don't worry Bernie....when a Dem wins the White House again, they can slash the budget for defence and ensure there are bi-partisan panels who agree all contracts over $1mill.
Cruz because I want Beto to win that badly.  Also, if Dems win the House, Ryan will lose his speakership and go down as one of the most pathetic individuals to ever hold the gavel. So that will bring me joy. Ryan losing his seat would be icing on the cake. https://t.co/UXI6gcJOTR < - > @jonfavs Totally agree with @jonfavs. Cruz followed by Ryan. After PA-18, with more than 100 districts considered tougher for the GOP to hold, we may be on track for a veto-proof House. Now THAT would be amazing. #BlueWave2018 #BlueTsunami2018 #VoterRegistration #Vote
The quote would be more at home in our 'since 1900' section. < - > I agree with this.
It won't solve all the problems, but it would at least minimize them. < - > Yes, I agree.
me after laughing at my own jokes https://t.co/jXnIReEY3V < - > @SAVAGEKERMlT @naomigg Having heard some of your best material, I would have to agree.
The Doctor and Wilf's interactions made up for some of the confusion, as did seeing the Master in women's clothing < - > I agree, the Doctor and Wilf scenes helped a lot.
But at least as a ''List of pseudosciences'' using WP:PSCI, it will be the exact same grey which we deal with at Category:Pseudoscience and on the individual article level - articles for those topics which reside in the grey amongst pseudo-, proto-, and fringe science. < - > I fully support that.
For real friends, this should be obvious: At a time of fake news spreading, meddling in our elections, and attacks on people on our soil with nerve agent, the response must not be transatlantic bickering but transatlantic unity. < - > @eucopresident @MattMurph24 Agree, Tusk I think that most Europeans do. But we need responsible leaders on the other side of the pond to agree. In actions, words, and tweets.
It sounds incredibly complicated and scary. < - > Technological progression in the games industry is a wonderful thing, but when you don't live and breath the job, it becomes hella hard to stay positive and on track.
''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide? < - > I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians.
With regard to < - > Agreed.
Nope. "Things you don't like" are not plot holes or subplots that go nowhere and just because you don't recognize a film's themes doesn't mean they're not there. https://t.co/1wBTnHf97Z < - > @DrewMcWeeny Well said. For the record i didn't like Last Jedi. I do appreciate that the film took risks that i just didn't agree with and thought looked silly. At least the movie wasn't some paint by numbers Jedi Academy movie.
Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama's biography, but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not. < - > Agreed, unless it's miraculously over due to this new top-hat, or buzz kill, or whatever procedure, we're only partway into a very long and complex event that will almost certainly involve the President further.
Hey @TylerD1amond. Sometimes crazy fans go way too far. Disturbing requests can get me storming out of the conversation like crazy fans do it. I agree with you buddy. I will be like, "That's it. Get out. Conversation over." And I block them for that. < - > @Clarence_Pryor @TylerD1amond I agree. Fans need to remember that they are real people. They don't have time to go through all this junk responding to these crazy requests. As a fan, your job is to support your idol. You should never get mad because they are to busy to answer. Give them a break!
SO CUTE < - > BUT AWWW, that pom is sooo adorable.
https://t.co/rmi4pri93R < - > @ShaneTHazel Can't agree with you more.
I'm really sorry to hear about that. < - > Ahhh bugger dude.
I respect the upkeepers of the article who, as far as i'm concered, are those active enough to check the Talk page. < - > Indeed, you have been nothing but civil, Talv, something that previous supporters of graphic depictions have never been.
Yeah for some reason we all slept really early last night. < - > It was indeed one of those nights for me too...
There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article. < - > Ditto Xandar.
Keep the single image, with a note as suggested, linking to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom article. < - > I support the inclusion of a note as suggested, and am neutral on the addition of the second coat of arms.
FranzFerdinandFranzFerdinandFranzFerdinand<3 You`ve made me need to go and listen to that song, now..! < - > Heee I -loooove- Franz Ferdinand <3
Annihilation is quite remarkable. Really fresh, cerebral, haunting sci-fi. I don't think I've ever seen those ideas explored before. < - > @IanDunt Agree
Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here, it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
Just merging the Topics text up to the lead and promoting its subheadings would also work, as I am not sure what heading would be appropriate; and Idiosyncratic ideas should probably be sorted and merged up, anyway. < - > That sounds like an intriguingly nice way to simplify the levels we're using.
Send it out! < - > XD And I totally will.
I think there is a good reason to have a fork but am not sure Hypnosadist has chosen the best title for the forked material. < - > If this is indeed the case, then the article titled Waterboarding in the 21st Century is, in its title at any rate, misleadingly anachronistic and, contrary to what some of its advocates seek to avoid (i.e.
However, I'm not sure the clause beginning with ''specifically'' needs to be there at all. < - > Agreed, a simple list should suffice, and ''intoxicants'' would be fine.
SES is rubbish. I studied in an elite school, have a title to my name. Yet I say fuck on twitter and eat chicken rice < - > @BasicNewbie agree!!! fuck!!!!
Agreeing with Bookkeeper here, also, this notion that we must give the masses what they want to read on this latest 'scandal' is completely wrong. < - > I also agree partially, But I'm not saying give the latest scandal, just give them the truth, many times people come to wiki for the truth, after they read some scandal within the tabloids.
This was my last gift to her, and I miss her already. < - > I'm so sorry, sweetie.
That better be one hell of a swimsuit!! < - > It's made out of Truffles I bet.
Current events are like a fast growing hedge in the spring, you have to keep trimming them back so they don't get unruly. Let the new shoots spring up and fill out the bush, cut them when they get too long. < - > As I mentioned we'll likely have to keep trimming things back periodically to keep it focused.
Naismith and his daughter had a creepy, borderline incestuous relationship < - > I totally thought the Naismiths were going to be a couple, too.
Maybe flipping them around and seeing ''Sanjuro'' first is the way forward, then. < - > Cool.
(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV. < - > It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. Viewing Religions as Dangerous.
Taking Opening Day off because I thoroughly believe it should be a national holiday. < - > @davysee9too I 100% agree. I'm sure you know this. Opening day here is expensive and there's going to be a sea or orange in Arlington that Thursday. I hope everyone just plays nice together.
Our Cotton Dell reserve in Oakamoor earlier this week. A stunning place in our amazing county. Where's your favourite open space in Staffordshire? #StaffordshireWildlifeHour (pic by Alan Walker) https://t.co/FS6FgaOPlD < - > @StaffsWildlife @RSPBCoombes Valley will always hold a very special place in my heart but agree that Cotton Dell is beautiful too. https://t.co/2Xd8MjPY9m
I don't believe that the ''Astronomy'' section should be under the ''practical effects'' section. < - > Wikt:practical: ''Being likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation; able to be put to use.'' I cannot fathom how Astronomy fits that definition, or will fit that definition until humanity gains an advantage from it aside from the theoretical (theory being the antonym).
Big Australia and bust: Immigration is a drag on our economy and lifestyle  ~ Dr Geoff Davies https://t.co/4vzPi0tdF6 < - > @independentaus agree

If I don't get some discussion and objections, I'm going to move ahead with this change. < - > I am fine with the change.
Everyone coming for the artist but his manager should also be held accountable. Smfh. https://t.co/k6AP5x7lI2 < - > @yikessilvana 100% agree  @censorthisplz and i, being co managers, for multiple artists ran through a scenario of what we'd do if this happened to a artist of ours if we so happened to drop the ball here and were unaware of these activities
Plus it's just more wordy and doesn't flow as well as the original text. < - > The extra info makes the sentence feel like a jolting roller-coaster of topics without stopping for a period break.
great, that'll be a change to my usual saturday routine of sleeeeeeeeeep < - > Meeep, i'd choose sleep over lectures anytime...poor you O_O Losing sleep is not good for the heart!
Writing always takes a billion times longer then you think it will. < - > @misscecil As a DM, can't agree more.
Your claim that ''there is no empirical evidence that HIV causes AIDS'' is simply untrue. < - > The WP:RS are unanimous: HIV causes AIDS.
I never said anything about having issues with other races. < - > I've never heard you be racist nor assumed you were racist so sorry if you felt I implied such a thing.
Each incident should be analyzed on its own merits, not on the popularity of a phrase. < - > I fully agree.
Ken, it's an 8-8 program. No better. No worse. My coverage of the #Cowboys fairly reflects that fact. I had 'access' to them when they went 4-12 same as I had 'access' when they went 13-3. https://t.co/ma1iXDAGeg < - > @fishsports 8-8 If they get a good draft. Even then its iffy. Free agency, no cap space and they are bottom feeders, so no help there. Mike Fisher gives his opinions, doesn't mince words. I (rarely) don't have to agree with him. But respect his thoughts. Has more access then most of us do.
We've done that before, and nobody ever said anything if it's just one person. < - > thanks for saying i can squeeze into the line with you guys :) and yeah people generally dont mind it seems i know ive done it in the past too, and my # is 646 303 8523
is worth risking your life? < - > Believe me, that's exactly what was going through my head!
good morning only to michael cera < - > @chrismelberger i agree
Really good news https://t.co/ntjBtMOtlJ < - > @JWoodcockMP I agree with @NiaGriffithMP , I think she is superb. But the days of trying to undermine JC should be over John. What are you trying to prove to whom? A 7 point lead can easily dwindle. JC deserves solidarity. Better to try to convince JC behind closed doors.
I assumed it wasn't for ethics since you said you'd eat a pig? I don't get why it's so offensive to say that animals lives matter just as much as ours. We both feel pain, have families and want to live. You are supporting a rank based system aka superiority. https://t.co/vYgm2F25Nw < - > @veganhales I'd eat a pig if I had no other option. I don't see eating animals out of necessity unethical. I agree all animals deserve to live, but I believe that sentience levels matters in determining what animals deserve to live more than others
12 is such a fragile age! < - > ya it is , and in some respects, part of him is still back there in time.
and those photos of nyaako are epic  < - > Aww so cute <3<3<3 I love Nyaako`s little dress~
The bullshit swirling around social media by Corbynistas about alternatives to Russian culpability are a terrible look and risk seriously damaging Corbyn.   If he was wise he would shut them down asap. < - > @MrRae1000 I would agree there is no viable alternative to Russian involvement. Can we wait for more evidence - the case against Russia we made in Litvenchenko case was very strong I thought.
Isn't my Mom just wicked talented? < - > Yes; it's fabulous!!!
And many Christians self-identify as Christian with the concomitant understanding that Christianity is the ''one true faith'' and the only path to salvation. < - > I'm actually in agreement myself.
EXCLUSIVE: @Foxtel is migrating ALL Cable TV customers to Satellite: https://t.co/dMRikOVgvt https://t.co/6CRsP7wudf < - > @EFTM @Foxtel Yes agree, storm rolls in, TV goes off. Every time no fail.
Just on principle. < - > Just on principle.
Everyone says it's stressful and awful, but I LOVE it. < - > yes.
Djathinkimacowboy, your behaviour seems odd to me that you ask for help, I give it, and you ''in general...agree with the action'' and then start this discussion to complain about what I just did. It kinda puts me off helping you again. < - > Well put Colin, I agree as well.
https://t.co/II9bXtScCn < - > @BreitbartNews I agree he is very sick.
Two recently added images include a dead dog, which I find random and in somewhat bad taste, and an image of the pope, along with caption making POV assertions about his entrance to the 'afterlife'. < - > The Dog is clearly the best illustration of death put forth so far imho, the pope one is indeed POV.
Two sentences do not warrant an individual section. < - > I don't feel that the incident yet deserves its own section, and sectioning it off in such a way would just encourage further recentism and tabloidesque details.
Oh man I LOVE those ladys. < - > I LOVE them too!
Of all people that I would have hoped to understand the plight of the repressed minority, I thought the African-American community would have understood. < - > I thought the African-American community would have understood.
I completely disagree with your claim that Sam Harris is radical, extremist or any of those other designations. Sam Harris assumes an activist role, but it most certainly isn't outside the mainstream. < - > lol. ok whatever. If unomi takes out the quote, I'll support that.
Libra, because fuck Libras. https://t.co/dmbFhyOI7j < - > @cat_lady_lexi UM WTF I am a Libra and we are the best sign and also Kim Kardashian would also agree because she's one too
Nonetheless, per consensus in the above section, and at Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#conerns_over_recent_domestic_violence_reports_between__Chris_Brown_and_Rihanna the section is to remain as is until 1) the investigation closes, or Rihanna speaks. < - > I agree completely with Bookkeeper and Realist2.
.@RandPaul: "It almost seemed to be a little bit of glee in her voice that [Gina Haspel] actually enjoyed the torture, and I think that's not who we need to lead the @CIA... We should not reward somebody who actually participated in torture treatment." https://t.co/8ohjhCkT3D < - > @FoxNews @RandPaul @CIA Finally, someone speaking sense! I agree why is anyone allowed this position that has a record like Gina? Didn't we learn from Flynn?
Not ideal either, but better, and I can't think of a better way to solve the problem. < - > I agree that it's not ideal.
The way I see it it's up to Trump to pick his side not Australian media. If he sacks ALL the globalists good on him. #credlin < - > @Scruffbucket Totally agree mate and I am Aussie this also applies to all the MSM Trump rules not u.

I'm not sure I'd have them one right next to each other, but Commons pictures are always welcome - much better than that image of the masked, street corner Santa - brr - that just gives me the willies.- < - > Yeah, there are other pictures scattered throughout the article.

This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama. < - > Agreed, unless it's miraculously over due to this new top-hat, or buzz kill, or whatever procedure, we're only partway into a very long and complex event that will almost certainly involve the President further.
Australians are unhappier than we were in 2017, says a new report. Do you agree? #9News https://t.co/zUTmAdhtWV < - > @9NewsAUS Yes I agree
What on earth is going on with the latest track from St. Vincent? Just terrible. Like a bad local radio advert jingle. Shame, as I really like some of her other songs. < - > @christianrt we saw her live on her Digital Witness tour - amazing! But I agree her stuff since that album hasn't been strong. A shame as she is a super talented musician.
I'm still confused by it all although John Simm in a dress made up for some of it. < - > rofl, he was working the Naismith daughter's pink dress.
Using Duffy as a reference at all should be kept to a minimum.In the Creed section I reverted the order to put the creed first. < - > I agree to a point RE:Duffy; I don't think he needs to be named and the opinion of one historian should not carry undue weight.Nothing wrong with ref 17; shows a variety of sources...you can't write simply from the POV of the church as an institution is always in the right...they screwed the pooch on how they handled the abuse cases as well as the lies they put out whenever a Pope dies.--
No, but I'll go on as your lesbian lover while YOU confess that you used to be a man, and then reveal that I'm okay with that, because I'm trisexual, and I'm secretly doing your kitty when you're not looking. < - > hahahahahaha YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Actually wouldn't calling it ''Standard English'' instead of ''British English'' not be a better and mroe neutral idea? < - > It'd be a brilliant idea!
The variety of ''Christian'' that would go around trying to codify the exclusivity of their beliefs into law has no more respect for atheists than it does for gays. < - > That's very true, but they haven't tried to take any civil liberties away from Atheists (yet)...
My response today to PM Theresa May's statement on the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. A firm and fair stance must be taken. https://t.co/P5p5Fnn4xR < - > @IanBlackfordMP many don't agree with @theresa_may version of events, are we being sold another lie like Iraq &amp; its WMD's is this another attempt to distract from a failing @conservative brexit, many don't believe it was the russians, you should be asking the PM WHY? https://t.co/CgayTl9KdX
The benefits from an university education: students more agreeable, conscientiousness https://t.co/6tJe4iT30D < - > @thebandb I do not agree. University leads to people to be more individualistic, striving for self-realization and gratification. In other Words personal succes. Consensus is like a social contract and contextual.
Asking Tyrann Mathieu to take a paycut is more effective when you don't give Sam Bradford $20M for one year. < - > @DanPizzuta Would agree with that

Twitter has gone full police state. Ideological discrimination is evident all over the platform. < - > @dbongino @europesperance https://t.co/f5WZ0Vrljb  You don't have to agree with a single world Jared Taylor says but if you value 1st Amendment &amp; free speech I urge people to support his lawsuit against Twitter (California legal precedent is on his side too)
And the issue is NOT just in the U.S.: andAs it stands now, the Roman Catholic Church article is not neutral. < - > It is that it is U.S.-centric.
Either way, it's ludicrously alarmist and a little nuts. < - > it's ludicrously alarmist and a little nuts

Giving details of every incident during his presidency is impossible. < - > Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now.
The article reports the incident, but it was the result of a complex sidetracking of a crusading army and against express Church orders. < - > I agree with Xandar, - As the person who has researched these events extensively using our scholarly works cited, our aritcle represents the view held by scholars.
I concur. Most jingoistic, but the worst ever approach to national security preparedness. https://t.co/CmCC9lwRZz < - > @rwac48 Agree there.

Meanwhile EU green energy policy makes EU more dependent on gas than ever.   #Brexit < - > @PeteNorth303 Ukraine agree. Georgia no. Saakashvili started the conflict in S.Ossetia thinking he had tacit approval of Bush. Abhkhazia invited in Russia for fear of a return to Georgian oppression.

Very interesting paper! Many of us have been saying how carbon prices is not a magical solution &amp; that we'll need complementary regulations for effective mitigation. @jurpelai @robbieorvis https://t.co/CRPixvARXO < - > @arvindpawan1 @jurpelai A question: what makes a carbon tax a "demand-side" policy. Isn't that subjective? What if it is administered upstream... wouldn't that qualify it as a supply-side policy? I agree with tenet that a broader suite of policies is more optimal...
No original research doesn't mean we check our critical judgment at the door; it's impossible to write a decent encyclopedia article without determining the quality and reliability of different sources. < - > I'm tired of saying exactly that, the problem is with a handful of editors who refuse to accept that that is what is meant by a neutral point of view and continually misrepresent the policy as 'no point of view'.
Unless there is a reliable source confirming verifiable proof of what seems now to only be accusations, I don't see eeason to change this article.-- < - > The info isn't really relevant.

How about: The deliberate Bombing of Guernica by the German Condor Legion in April 1937 contributed to widespread concerns that the next major war would include extensive terror bombing attacks on civilians.[2][3] The articles on the raid and the Condor Legion discuss the differing estimates of casualties. < - > I support it.--

The lead is already long, and contains references that are at least as definitive, and more current, than the ones you suggest. < - > Yes, there are other references, however, the lead currently states (9 of 10), which is on the high end of that estimates.

I'm discovering something very interesting about feminist discourse:  if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears, I will almost certainly learn something significant from it. < - > There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time, it's my own argument that gets vivisected.
I thus suggest that we create a second disclaimer, such as, ''The following statistical resources may be created by those with a non-neutral position in the abortion debate.'' Site such sites as the AGI and Johnston's Archive, unfortunately, fall into a grey area between purely neutral parties and clear-cut advocacy groups. < - > I'm satisfied with Severa's proposed compromise.--
In the Commons chamber now. There is only one appropriate response to the actions of the Russian Federation on UK soil - nothing less than unequivocal condemnation. I very much welcome the tranche of measures the PM has just announced which have been praised across the House. https://t.co/f1k3aKqr6W < - > @ChukaUmunna Generally agree with you Chukka, but there is a world of difference between conjecture and evidence. No facts disclosed here. Are you sure 100% based on facts? Would a court convict? Don't think so.
Perhaps, but ' domestic violence' doesn't come anywhere near describing public murders. < - > Just to remind that in archive 8 part 14 and 15 we discussed already the word ''terrorism'' and it was clear that the majority support it.
lol although that really tall girl was REALLY pretty (and Li Na was even prettier but she was eliminated early on) ..I didn't like her though < - > The tall one seemed a little obnoxious to me XDD I dunno, hahaha.
In fact, in celebration of those prepped foods which just sometimes will save your sanity, here are some of my favourites: stock cubes, frozen spinach, fish fingers, those sachets of prepped grains and rice Merchant Gourmet sell, tinned pulses, cream of tomato soup. You? < - > @lickedspoon Agree with all on the thread. We had cream of mushroom soup in the cupboard, and cornflour! For the time a sauce was needed and no butter around for a roux, getting vegetables into my brothers when the soup wouldn't work anymore. Pea sauce was genius..
Having conversations on eljay, when we're both on MSN! < - > me too
Happy Birthday! < - > HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
urghhhh I LOOOOOOVE the country!!! < - > ITS ALWAYS GOOD NO MATTER WHAT, BECAUSE IN THE COUNTRY THERE'S ALWAYS CRAZY PEOPLE AND FREE BOOZE
But calling your baby ugly and calling you a slut because of things like having fake boobs, oh my fucking god they're pathetic. < - > Those people are just bored, no life-having idiots who have nothing better than to bitch about someone elses life..
I was very leery of Xion going in, because dude I've seen this plot and it sucked when it was fanfic, but actually she is awesome and tragic and WOES. < - > :(  I believed in her character, where that kind of thing would take really REALLY good fanfic to be convincing, yeah?
I'd vote for removing it from the lead. < - > I was thinking myself that it wasn't really a lead matter, and since that sentence is duplicated virtually word for word at its proper place in the article, it should go.
I'm so sorry, sweetie. < - > I'm so sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry for your loss. < - > I'm so sorry to hear the news.
We knew triumph and redemption. < - > I'm thrilled :)
Basically the folks who want to cry racism and what not are blithering idiots  who never managed to open their minds enough to see what this movie was about. < - > yes, at every point.
I hope you have a good time! < - > Have a fab time!
They have no place in the introduction. < - > There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article.
In reality it was the first terror blanket bombing, carried out against a civilian city with little, possibly none, military value. < - > The bombing of Gernika was indeed the first blanket bombing in history and a test for all other blanket bombings to come during WW2.
For example, Wikipedia mentions notable criticisms of Barack Obama, but none are mentioned on the main page because of how strongly the editors there fight it. < - > So there is a consensus that there be no oil spill and birther controversy but there is probably (or should be consensus) that the economy and health care are legimate controversies about Obama.
i just want to say that toy is a really nice person and he deserves all the love you can give to him https://t.co/ShNZah8cTu < - > @MismagiusBD I wholly agree with both you and toy
I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt (which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit, coney, cunny etc. < - > Your solution was the right call, and yes, for the right reasons.
If you want to print a webpage and make it look nice, it shouldn't matter what browser you're using (unless one has terrible layout issues for printed pages) as the proper better printed font rendering will be used in each case. < - > You might be right, and if you are, then there's no case where Safari would be better for media, other than possibly a projector.
Perhaps you would care to suggest a specific addition or alteration. < - > You keep saying there's all these noteworthy problems that should be included in Obama's page yet you fail to name one.
i just tuck it real welll LOL < - > Oh I know, I found it that one time :D
I'm not saying what I wrote can't be improved upon, I'm saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter, if it then makes it lopsided, is not the answer here.And to Wikidemon's already beginning editing, regardless of the colloquial use of their former name, they are not actually called ''British Petroleum''. < - > Okay, we can clean up a few things.
LLLINKKK Did I just spend an hour watching John Simm rub food on his face and maniacally laugh? < - > That episode was so terrible, my head is still spinning from it's suck.
I agree to a point RE:Duffy; I don't think he needs to be named and the opinion of one historian should not carry undue weight.Nothing wrong with ref 17; shows a variety of sources...you can't write simply from the POV of the church as an institution is always in the right...they screwed the pooch on how they handled the abuse cases as well as the lies they put out whenever a Pope dies.-- < - > Using Duffy as a reference at all should be kept to a minimum.In the Creed section I reverted the order to put the creed first.
I hope you feel better soon. < - > Get well soon!
But next week. patio drinks. < - > yes its a date baby.
It has been &amp; I agree. https://t.co/0IFgy0lF1n < - > @bainjal U r taking like politican i agree today swati and u sleep in peace .But just think about those caste they r not vote banks wt will they do.U like muslims and christans
This article is way to American-centric. < - > I agree, considering that technique has been used for a long time and in many different circumstances.
Damn, u right sis https://t.co/MkD8JNuXZx < - > @jeseniaaarico I agree
'It was a radical revelation for me, that I could write something and change it before my parents ever read it.'  @bkjabour on Working with Words: https://t.co/Uc81aKC6lY https://t.co/ITLtB0zOtk < - > @wheelercentre @bkjabour Hard agree with the Catcher take. I loathed it in Yr 11 and when we had to review it as a class at least 3 people said I reminded them of Holden, a devastating time.
Only a president who views everything through the lens of TV could think Larry Kudlow was suitable to be National Economic Advisor.  Because he's not an economist in any sense of the word, he just plays one on television.  Fake experts for fake advisory roles.  Trumptopia. < - > @djrothkopf And he also kisses Trump's a$$ which is what Trump wants... not real information or thoughtful dialogue... he wants people to sit down, shut up and agree with him.  #LarryKudlow
2 down, Erica! < - > But hey, you just got past two of em today, so be teh happeh.
I think this is a fine proposal. < - > I'm not sure if this is possible at all, but this is the closest one so far, IMO.
A ticket worth of Rs 8000 &amp; 12000 is too much for an average Pakistani. #PSL < - > @aaliaaaliya Totally agree with you
@ReDiCampania thoughts? Do you think Messi has perfected his playing style, to the point where another level cannot be reached? https://t.co/NucHgjFZCJ < - > @ThomasSimpson01 Overall good thread. Last thought is a bit contrived, but I do agree if a player does surpass Messi he will play similarly and take stylistic influence from him.
WATCH: Bernie Sanders speaks to students protesting gun violence: "We are very proud" https://t.co/UGWigR0zMk https://t.co/BappD35ptP < - > @thehill I hope u can all agree that Bernie or Clinton would have been a million times better than scumpf! Stop bickering and focus getting this house blue to impeach orange cheetor
So are we on for the 7:30 show, then? < - > Yup!
This was my last gift to her, and I miss her already. < - > I'm so, so sorry to hear that.
Good luck, I know you can get everything figured out and put back together, if you put your mind to it. < - > Very true.
Alternatively, a [Note] be added to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom link beneath the single CoA image, stating that a form of arms specifically for use in Scotland exists which differs from that form displayed in the infobox. < - > I support the inclusion of a note as suggested, and am neutral on the addition of the second coat of arms.
Guy's I REALLY hope that IF this is the Nathan James last deployment that they DON"T KILL anyone off. The death of Dr. Scott was heart-wrenching enough. Agreed? https://t.co/njiqTG8Nrz < - > @TRaraigh Yes! I totally agree! I will NOT be a happy camper if they take my fave Captain away! It was bad enough last season to lose Sunshine he was an awesome #NathanJames helo  pilot I really liked him!
However, I can understand their motivations, in that they are wishing to ''humanize'' and ''personalize'', abortion, and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images. < - > However, I agree with you about those who seek to portray all abortions in the same way (although it is *quite* possible to find quite graphic photos for most surgical procedures and the saline abortion method).
The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a spy.  Can we now expel the Russian Diplomat in the Oval office for poisoning American values, our democracy and the US Constitution? < - > @krassenstein #ImpeachTrump !!!!! I agree! We need the #BlueWave2018 to continue til November! Time to put an end to all this! Everyone has to VOTE!!!!
Is Wikipedia even going to mention it, or at least that he went down to the Gulf to check on the spill's cleanup process? < - > This is a biography cover his entire life.
I agree that the first five lines are wonderfully unique. < - > beautiful (i love poems about stars) i love the first lines and how your strong tone builds and builds and the poem progresses.
If the criticism or debate over this are important enough, we can simply report that some people criticized or disparaged the president, using this as an argument. < - > Indeed.
Similarly with the points relevant to indians position as ''children'', this is very vague and gives no law, date or time that can be pinpointed. < - > I agree with you that we should check the source for the ''children'' comment.
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV. < - > That's not the only NPOV issue either.
Some authors consider that the attack was a tactical military operation and reduce casualties to 300 - 400 dead28][29]. < - > Yes, Beevor supports those casualty figures, and cites them to two Spanish-language books.
What an incredibly discouraging world we live in. What a challenge it poses to find light amid the darkness. < - > @tonyschwartz Very insecure and very scary times! Absolutely agree https://t.co/iuYTxcFcj4
Does anyone enter/plan to enter students for Lit GCSE at the end of Y10? Interested in your thoughts/approaches etc. Thank @Team_English1 < - > @Lit_liverbird @Team_English1 I think that extra year's maturity is of immense value in terms of responding to the Lit texts. I also agree that Lang/Lit are mutually enriching. And, yes, Lit in year 10 would necessitate a year 9 start.
This section should be cut down to two or three sentences at the most. This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama. < - > Even if it's just a sentence or two under Domestic policy (subject to expansion in the future if he takes more direct action concerning the spill), it should at least be mentioned.
As I see it, the whole point of all of this is to debunk the creationist ''2nd law'' claim. < - > By the way, the fact that it's obvious to everyone that this material exists to ''debunk the creationist ''2nd law'' claim'' is why I think it should be moved to the section on creation vs.
The old figure of 350 million Buddhists in the world is obviously totally outdated, particularly given the recent rise of Buddhism in China where 20% of the population tend to identify as Buddhist. The outright number of Buddhists in the world today is probably between 600 and 700 million, and many studies endorsing similar figures can be found throughout the web. < - > I am in complete agreement with you, but unfortunately, others are not, and they have overturned my edits.
It is only rationale to consider this a list of topics ''what have been characterized as'' as there is no way to properly source whether something is ''currently characterized as''! < - > I'll admit that is funny, and also quite correct.
It is the court which has lost its credibility: Swaminathan Gurumurthy,   Political Commentator  #MaransAfter2G https://t.co/uoDFUchL3v < - > @TimesNow I totally agree with Mr. Gururthy
Neither of them won. < - > yeah :( its those stupid idiots that give bike riders a bad rep too!
What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture. < - > Strong support.
Will Republicans listen to students who have taken a stand against gun violence or continue to block bills that most Americans agree with? #NationalSchoolWalkout < - > @SenFeinstein Students are indoctrinated children. We adults know what you're up to. Most adult Americans do not agree with your gun grabbing ways Di.
If you actually read that article, you will find the ''critics'' are non-notable residents of the nowhere-near-the-spill NYC area. < - > I'd also point out that half of everything these days is being nicknamed ''Obama's Katrina,'' such as the earthquake in Haiti.
They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative. < - > I know I don't actually edit here much but I have been watching this process closely and regardless of where they came from I actually concur with both suggestions, with the caveat that the proposed reorganization may take some effort to dovetail well.
The comic relief scruffy Cajun lightning bug and the Voodoo Shadow Man villian characters were overly broad. < - > Though he was overly broad (and the stereotype bad guy), I kinda liked Shadow Man.
I'm hot, you're hot. Let's get it poppin < - > @_BellMarkell I agree
If I hear one more dude mention how raves are supposed to be a "safe space" for everyone...   In a safe space, men would hold each other accountable for their actions and definitely not protect/ignore their bro's actions of unacceptable behavior towards women < - > @Krewella a good chunk of men do, if they aren't putting that man in his place then they're either his piece of shit friends or some other complete shit stain.. there're plenty of good guys at shows that specifically call out shitty people like that. 100% get what you're saying and agree,
Thought that was too big a coincidence. < - > Yeah, definitely.
Ppl are encouranging bdk2 skrg yang SPM is not everything, but hey. SPM is everything. Cerita zombie kampung pisang pun respect orang ada SPM < - > @amiwaaina Tbh it's similar like Cambridge O lvls. Yes I agree It's not everything but what you decide to do right after getting the results that matters the most.  But at the same time Good results will help to ease your pathway even more in all aspect .
2) Dudeman, at age 85, has a gotten a touch of senile dementia that's affected him from investigating over 70,000 cases of demonic possession over his career. < - > I think it's 2).
We need a leader not an apprentice. @OfficeOfRG https://t.co/TV4KyiLhTZ < - > @vivekagnihotri @OfficeOfRG You are prejudiced, hence can't see without the help of foggy lenses. Let your El Supremo hold one press conference, then l will agree to all your leadership theories.

this game is so fun https://t.co/Tpr2u0JMIK < - > @etdragonpunch Finally something related to video games I agree with you on.
I'm guessing the anon is misreading the 2004 senate race section; the sentence declares that Braun was Fitzgerald's predecessor, not Obama's. < - > My guess as well.
I know none of these people - I'll stick with Eddie Izzard, Stephen Fry and Billy Connelly thanks :) < - > I'm going to have to back Doris up on Stephen Fry.
For some reason I found myself thinking of Xolani Gwala. I think he is the missing voice during these exciting times. Wishing him well! < - > @VusiPikoli Agree
This argument is completely irrelevant and wrong, first, because MA was referring the ''occupying Zionist regime''. < - > The translation needs to change, agreed.
The most handsome men on Twitter rarely have their real DPs. < - > @Roflindian I agree, don't know about others but personal experience.
This disabled woman was literally starved and dehydrated to death, and posting photographs of her brain does not excuse what actually ocurred. < - > This woman was literally starved and dehydrated to death in this country under a judicial order, while still communicative and breathing without any artificial life support, other than basic sustenance - food and water.
but thank god the quality of the content available for rare ships are top tier https://t.co/3rZWCuhHoS < - > @namjoonses OOF YES I AGREE
The lead paragraph to this article misses the fundamental defining criterion of capitalism: that production is structured around the accumulation of capital - investment in order to realize a financial profit and reinvestment of that profit in production. The lead paragraph places undue weight on one aspect of capitalism, namely distribution of income (in a manner intended to glorify the system). < - > I think the lead needs to highlight things that make capitalism distinctive, e.g. what makes the last couple of hundred years of economic growth different from any two hundred year period of Roman history or Chinese history. I think one difference is that capitalism grows through the intensification of production (phrase this however you want) and this occurs because a significant portion of profits is invested in new technologies (as opposed to more slaves or more land). So I agree with Battlecry.
Cayetano on Duterte vs. Zeid: Presidents can be disrespectful, UN HR execs cannot https://t.co/FjfIIUqKzO < - > @gmanews Agree have you seen @realDonaldTrump rants lately against fake news and stupid people! He has the right and they deserved it! Thank you Pres. Trump!
Because the page sees several instances of vandalism every day by anons, I would like to ask Wassupwestcoast, our local admin on the page, to please reconsider his removal of the semi-security protection of this page. < - > I would agree it's unnecessary for now.
Monument Valley is incredibly delightful, I feel very strongly about this, please talk to me about it < - > @alexisnotafish I couldn't agree more. My experience was a perfect 12/10 https://t.co/v7LjBZs5hp
IT got Lakers looking like a completely different team < - > @BoobiT77 I agree! Resign IT, give Randle the contract he deserves to keep him in LA and go after a big name free agent. If they can get two great, but with the way this young group looking, they'll do damage with just one
oh browns you wasted a hall of fame career < - > @MockingTheDraft if he was a qb or rb people would doubt his hall worthiness, because postseason. Ftr I don't agree with that thinking
I could probably go for Yojimbo/Sanjuro on the Wednesday night. < - > That sounds good too.
I don't agree that there was a huge void. It'll be a long time before anyone lives up to V/M of course, so I get what you mean, but they are once in a generation. There was a lot of promise though, if the ISU could have just let things breathe... the field would have flourished. https://t.co/1Sb7s8BdT0 < - > @canadablues I agree there are so many promising teams, but I think V/M are once in a billion years. I don't think we'll be seeing another team like them even if humanity lives on for a long, long time. Still a lot to love from other teams.
In order of the most preferred:  1. Sevilla. 2. Roma. 3. Liverpool.  4. Man City. 5. Real Madrid. 6. Bayern Munich. 7. Barcelona.  #CLdraw < - > @ADP1113 Pretty much. The last 4 are interchangeable. Stylistically, City are the most horrible match-up for Juve but they lack the experience and pedigree of the other 3 so I agree with your placement.
A single notable source advocating a fringe viewpoint still isn't enough to stand up to an avalanche of more noteworthy respectable sources. < - > I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully.
The opening line should read ''the 44th, and current President. < - > The comments above regarding the comma are correct (one comma is wrong, and two commas would not be helpful).
-(undent) ''pro-life'' is a U.S. political category, not a Catholic one. < - > And why are we still using the non-Catholic word ''pro-life'' ( consistent life ethic may work better).
gosh you are so beautiful < - > Looks really good!
No, there are too many views and the differences are complex. It is a long enough article. < - > Agree there are too many views.
Nope, common descent does not produce biodiversity. < - > This may be rather confused, but basically I agree with Roland.
I think that this part of the charter should be posted; it is relevant to Hamas and the sympathizers who ask ''why are we so hated'' should not deny it, considering it is an Hamas ideal. < - > I think it should be posted.
Hugs to the both of you. < - > *huggles*
being in someone's prayers is the purest form of real love.. < - > @1Hakz_ I agree
The only reason I'd ever buy marshmallows, IF I ever do. https://t.co/7WX3UXyXZB < - > @um3awas I agree. The thought of eating marshmallows just makes me want to wretch and gives me the heebie jeebies.
Seriously, how did the Master become Voldemort and start jumping over buildings and shooting lightning from his arms? < - > I know.
Think it would be best to simply listen to what has been said here and realizes that the removal of the ulrs is causing this whole problem. I see no policy/guideline for there removal - but do see an RfC that is quoted above and a few other pages that mention how to use the urls in the templates like at WP:PAGELINK and {{ cite book}}. So at this point i am very surprised to see they have not been reinstated - by the person that has removed them. < - > I've certainly found the URLs useful in the past, and there's no real advantages to removing them.
i think about doing something like this occasionally. < - > I might just do it...
Nobody trades away good left tackles ... except for the Texans in October 2017. https://t.co/OZ4krUhYxU < - > @GregRajan A good left Tackle that was more worried about making more money than helping team win, and that was after they had already paid him. Dont agree to a contract and then sit out for more money
Also feel free to tell future generations that network television started to die the day they gave Leno a prime time talk show. < - > Agreed one thousand percent.
I want to visit you at work more often. < - > VISIT ME MORE OFTEN IT MAKES ME SMILE
Judicial and spousal murder is exactly the correct terminology. < - > It was judicial and spousal murder, pure and simple.
No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists. < - > Indeed.
and all of this bullshit where they refuse to hold a temporary ceasefire to allow foreign national tourists to safely evactuate, as fucked up and shitty as that is, has me simply livid. < - > That said, everybody just needs to stop.
RTD has some serious explaining to do because part one was one big clusterfuck of story lines. < - > Yeah, I don't know.
80% of rich people are stupid https://t.co/tG3XpqAr2a < - > @yayanridzuann @hafizeehushaini Totally agree!
She was given an opportunity to succeed, and she did! < - > She was given an opportunity to succeed, and she did!
This said, before this discussion continues, perhaps all who have not should review Severa's links to Archives 14, 16, and 20, as well as the discussion with Ros Power above. < - > Indeed.
The Sam Harris blockquote ...No one ever needs to identify himself as a ''non-astrologer'' or a ''non-alchemist.'', etc, seems pertinent. < - > Yeah, that's the bit I was referring to.
@TedescoTime happy birthday. march&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; < - > @19_alex_04 Best month to be born in, 100% agree
Put two sentences plus a wikilink here in the main article.Regarding the comment that the scandal is a drop in bucket of 2 000 years of Catholic history, there are plenty of good reputable sources that put the scandal in context of the church's history without the the fault of 'recentism'. < - > I think that the article should have only a few sentences on the sex scandals - that is very recent, whereas the Church's efforts to set up missions have been quite longstanding (think of the Jesuits).
If we can't use the word terrorism, an opinion I'm sceptical about, then we must use words such as murder. < - > The characterization regarding the use of the term terrorism on Wikipedia (''not allowed'') is incorrect.
Aww so cute <3<3<3 I love Nyaako`s little dress~ < - > I am so jealous of your cat dollfie!
lol although that really tall girl was REALLY pretty (and Li Na was even prettier but she was eliminated early on) ..I didn't like her though < - > and yup, I like this girl better than the tall one.
Ros Power, you are just another twat pushing his POV here. < - > Any bold moves on the main page will quickly be removed and wouldn't earn you any favor among the regular editors.
My mother reckons Wilf's going to have to kill Ten to save Donna or something, 'cause of the whole 'you've never killed a man' thing that TV woman said. < - > It definitely sounded like he will have a hand in killing someone/thing, at least.
And honestly, if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice, I'd probably at least consider using Safari; the stuff is more typographically ''correct'' using that rendering, which in the context of an image of a site may well look better. < - > That having been said, I'd probably consider Safari if I wanted to print a web page and make it look nice.
So much opportunity here, not just in primary care. Plenty that can be done by hospital drs too, and by bringing in PTs/rehab trainers to support pts. @CanRehab @Liz_ORiordan @abcdiagnosis @exerciseworks https://t.co/ervNKcmSNg < - > @SimonMDLord @Liz_ORiordan @CanRehab @abcdiagnosis @exerciseworks Agree 100% there needs to be greater respect for knowledge of exercise specialists and wide MDT collaboration. So much we can offer.
Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today! < - > @realDonaldTrump In strongly agree with you sir
But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan, Letterman, Ferguson, or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now. < - > ferguson rocks.
The most handsome men on Twitter rarely have their real DPs. < - > @Roflindian I totally agree  Actually it becomes very embarrassing sometimes to handle the female followers in dm, when you are displaying your original pic.
oh my it's so cute. < - > thats too cute.
Important 'current issues' are important to this article. < - > I agree that the article needs more on the Church throughout the world, but in a much broader way than has been proposed here - mission work, for example.
Sorry, just a very enthusiastic reaction to linguistic accuracy. < - > When used correctly, words are neat!
Shall we meet at about 6:45? < - > I'll head down to the Film Forum and plan on getting there around 6:45 or so.
Well climate changers how you going to prevent stuff like this? Massive solar storm slamming into Earth TOMORROW could cause power outages and stunning views of the Northern Lights https://t.co/wwNAsJAe7U < - > @GregWest_HALOJM Also causes massive weather anomalies. This is real global warming. its atmospheric bombardment. Liberals wouldn't agree though.
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV. < - > It is NPOV and cited.
While I don't at all agree with the seal hunt, I give huge props to this:Senator fires back at U.S. < - > That is so awesome.
I am opposing using pictures of blood, cut limbs, resected bowels, resected pancreas etc in any article here. < - > We agree on the same thing, I'm opposed to having pictures that are unhelpful as well.
How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''. < - > I would agree.
THIS from the former WH Comms Director. Words matter, Sean. https://t.co/ow10PGwmlv < - > @DearAuntCrabby I would agree that he severed the United States from the rest of the world.
Someone might say the same thing towards a picture of an alley in Calcutta of dying and starving children due to overpopulation, yet this is an appeal to emotion rather than a representation of information relevant to the article. < - > Shock images, whether ''pro-life'' or ''pro-choice,'' serve little to no informative purpose.
Our first heading is quite long, and against our MOS, it contains most of the title of the article:I suggest we shorten it to ''Topics''. < - > Not ideal either, but better, and I can't think of a better way to solve the problem.
He was misquoted by the BBC. < - > as for the topic discussed, i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation ''wipe israel off the map'' is a misquote.
Strong R here at 65 now.if u must buy let it pull back to 60 at least. Buying must have been done on 55 not at 65 lol < - > @TicTocTick agree

Bugger the vampires, Annie and George are why I watch Being Human. < - > 'being human'- you're so right.
my camera is nothing special but I want to try! < - > I have often thought about doing something like this.
I choose plain and utterly brilliant because sparkling conversations and learning is smexy. < - > Brilliant and ugly, hands down.
There's plenty of evidence that HIV causes AIDS. < - > Your claim that ''there is no empirical evidence that HIV causes AIDS'' is simply untrue.
Suicide bombing of buses is a terrorist act, and there's no dispute that Hamas is doing that - meaning that Hamas employs terrorist tactics. < - > Hamas did bomb civilian targets, which is a terrorist tactic.
Labour MP tells @BethRigby they have zero confidence in Jeremy Corbyn over national security. In which case they have an obligation to resign the Labour-whip. National security is the primary responsibility of any government or opposition. < - > @DPJHodges @BethRigby Cannot believe I would ever agree with #HorridHodges  but Lab MPs who accuse Jeremy Corbyn of putting UK security at risk have DUTY to RESIGN. That it is clearly Tory Govt who are risking global security just like Blair and WMD myth. We know what a catastrophe that caused.
Yes, I agree. < - > Ditto.
How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''. < - > Support.
I have no issue with VA secretary shulkin being an Obama holdover, other than the fact that he's treating our great veterans like an Obama holdover would treat them, our veterans deserve better! < - > @StephenMilIer @FussellEvelyn AGREE! THIS COUNTRY HAS HYSTORICALLY SWEPT OUR VETERANS' NEEDS UNDER THE RUG SINCE WW1. THOSE BRAVE PEOPLE WERE ILLEGALLY, UNCONSENTEDLY TESTING ON THEM &amp; THEN SENT THEM OFF TO WAR, UNDER PREPARED, UNDER ARMED, UNDER INFORMED &amp; CAME BACK TO EVEN WORSE CIRCUMSTANCES! IT'S TIME!!
Lately, I can't even listen to political shit on the radio. < - > I've been listening to news less lately, too.
Pleeeeeeeeease!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/xkO0lHmaTO < - > @happyproduct Whole-heartedly agree!
I would remove his opinion from Name of Canada. < - > Ok with me ...we should link up his name wherever the statement is as he is a members of the Order of Canada.
republicans have a right to vote too. < - > clearly, republicans have the right to vote.
I move to replace the first and all paragraphs in the introduction with that sentence. < - > I actually would have no problem with that personally.
An absolutely wonderful piece on objectification of women in politics (applicable elsewhere too) by the wise Mrinal Pande. Lage raho, Naresh bhai https://t.co/deEmHmmowo via @IndianExpress < - > @_sabanaqvi @IndianExpress Agree. Sentiments respected. If woman is an epitome of respect would you defend Renuka Choudhary's villainous laughter that too when PM was speaking.
In support of the above, I would like to note that the current text is clearly inaccurate and could almost be interpreted as a justification of the bombing, as it seems to imply that the bombing of Guernica was a military operation, and that ''propaganda'' figures were used to magnify the event. < - > Right now this part of the article is grossly misleading.
Hoping after reading this thread people will be sympathetic to our cause. Today it is AI. Tomorrow it will be another PSU which is also loss making due to government policies. Today, as per passenger feedback, AI is the most appreciated Indian carrier compared to Jet Indigo etc. https://t.co/56FamqsU8Z < - > @Kavita_M57 I agree, it is pride of India just like HMT watches or Ambassador Cars.  Govt can turn it around. It needs to be treated like NTPC or BHEL or ONGC.
that just made my chest hurt. < - > it makes my chest hurt, too.
This was my last gift to her, and I miss her already. < - > Just so, so sorry.
Full development of #Gwadar would make Pakistan hub of regional trade: Ahsan Iqbal https://t.co/xgZIngZEcS https://t.co/DrvcDVxQbX < - > @RadioPakistan Agree
Certainly much better than before. < - > On the topic of citations: a good counter citation would be one that discredits the current disppute of his connections with the UGLE or regular freemasonry.
Someone i met at uni today told me i sOUnd like emma watson today the transformation is complete kayleigh no longer exists < - > @howoojis Ooh yes I agree Hahaha
PINEAPPLE BELONGS ON PIZZA CONFIRMED https://t.co/OvnflBmy6h < - > @SilliLilli_ Sorry Lilly you're amazing and all but I'll never agree to that https://t.co/sIK2amPU5x
She was so, so messed up, even before the drugs! < - > I read another book about her life and it was so tragic but I would like to read another book so I think I will try this one.
The first was insensitive comments about people with AS and a following discussion that did not cite any sources nor did it concern itself with the rewording/improvement of article text. < - > It is agreed, citations are needed that conform to medical; I was merely proposing something and I get cybermugged.
There are two that are way out of left field, and I can't even start to guess how those different episodes are going to be tied together. < - > Oh lord, you're right when you say you can't even begin to string the episodes together.
We took our country back. < - > The USA was reborn yesterday.
The sources which we choose should be trustworthy/authoritative in presenting the sources characterization. < - > Or, better yet, we might consider following WP:RS and require that our sources be ''generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand'' (emphasis in original), with a little WP:WEIGHT thrown in to cover disagreement among sources.
A ticket worth of Rs 8000 &amp; 12000 is too much for an average Pakistani. #PSL < - > @aaliaaaliya  I agree that price of tickets is too much
The Post-It Notes totally look like something i'd do! < - > handmade gifts are the best..
I think Americans can have full confidence that if ever we were drowning, Donald Trump would throw us a life preserver prototype. < - > @AnnCoulter If I were to stumble and fall, if President Donald Trump were nearby, I believe he would come over and help me up instead of his Secret Service men.  Yes, I agree with you statement.
don't scratch your naughty bits. < - > I could have told you this
very nice! < - > i love it.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > The sentence at the top is close to the reworking that I gave the earlier sentence, and I agree that it can be improved.
and all these manditory family encounters that stress me the fuck out, the rest of the year im pretty successful at avoiding my parents. < - > You really don't need the added crazy of family on top of it all.
A1) It has changed my experiences in almost everything because of how much easier things are now and how much more accessible they are as well. If I want to learn how to get something done, I usually just have to get on google and search it up! Especially for papers! #csubted < - > @sandyoj23 I have to agree with you. It is much easier  to ask or access the internet for help or just looking up strategies, ideas, etc. for your classroom work.
Wikipedia will never be completely neutral because collectively, editors are biased.-- < - > Wikipedia aims to reflect reliable, secondary sources, which are always biased when it comes to politics.
I am so sorry. < - > I'm so sorry for your loss.
An hour just doesn't seem long enough to fit it all in. < - > I agree, the next episode is going to have to go so fast to cram everything in.
An important milestone has presently been announced in that the Vatican now concedes that Islam has overtaken it in size according to 2006 figures. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
However, I can understand their motivations, in that they are wishing to ''humanize'' and ''personalize'', abortion, and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images. < - > I also agree that too many people are out to use the article to score political points, not to create an encyclopedia.
According to some, it's always management's fault, no matter what. Like, it's GM's fault if Benn doesn't play like last year. Same for Alzner if he doesn't play like he did in Wash. Ditto for Shlemko. It's also their fault for all the injuries or that players are lazy or dumb. < - > @JJonesey Alzner was already showing signs that he had declined, which is part of the reason he fell down the depth chart in Washington. Agree with the rest though.
my school in Alabama walked out. we stood up for ourselves...in the process our teachers mocked us, threatened us, and tried to silence us. one teacher started ARGUING with me.   BUT WE MUST NOT BACK DOWN  #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @ughh_erin Why "walk out" (with zero consequences), other than an appropriation of a "cause" to self-congratulate yourself? Why not instead, get together with all of your asshole classmates &amp; like-minded automatons, and agree to stop being assholes and shooting one another? Too hard?
It would be obfuscating consensus to replace them with other words because thats not what is used. < - > I agree it would be ''obfuscating'' to turn the heading of AIDS Denialism into something like ''Alternative Theories'' but I also think it is obfuscating to lump all skeptical scientists together when they clearly do not share the same beliefs about HIV's role.
i swear to god, the more and more that i learn the angrier i get. < - > I'm with you though, I find the whole thing reprehensible.
I adore moving. < - > yes.
when someome assumes your post is about them, that shows they got a guilty conscience. if you ever think im subbing you, u dead wrong. i dont need to sub.... < - > @aleeyadavanzo I Agree.sometimes @aleeyadavanzo they post some thing that we feel Guilty.They don't need a sub or a follow if they mess with the wrong people today are any day in the future.
This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''. This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > Yes, that's much better and I think rather unambiguous.
The clothing district was probably the most challenging out of all of them. < - > And yet, the one that seemed the most fun.
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump You mean like selling our foreign, national security and trade policy to the highest foreign bidder?  I agree.
It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like, ''Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31, 2010 [45]. < - > While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.
Glad I'm not the only one with urges to mock/mark up Hummers. < - > The urge to take my keys and carve OH MY GOD YOU FUCKING MORON into the side of their shiny paint job is absolutely incredible.
I love those shoes *_*. < - > Thank you *-* I can`t wait to wear them out <3
A stylistic decision makes a very good hat. < - > A stylistic decision makes a very good hat.
LOL < - > LOL
I'm having a very hard time seeing why the first would be preferable. < - > I agree that the first is wordy and generally a failure at style.
Which I've been planing on bringing back in style. < - > I love my 3D glasses!
@cosmicbrowniee https://t.co/3o1jbpsptt < - > @Flaccophile *defiantly agree*
I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn't see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all, just about gay marriage. < - > Yep, that's exactly what I'm saying.
I will be filing a bill tomorrow that will prohibit airlines from putting animals in overhead bins. Violators will face significant fines. Pets are family. < - > @SenJohnKennedy Agree that pets are family and a bill to protect them is great. But kids are family, too. A bill to protect them from AR-15s, like a law prohibiting them, would be great, too.
Pretty sure all of the Doctor/Master shippers collectively fainted when they got all up in each other's faces and mind melded or whatever. < - > As a Doctor/Master shipper I can confirm that it was pretty exciting and I genuinely thought for a moment Rusty would throw in a kiss, in a flurry of Master-Insanity and Christmas cheer.
The page we have for that is the disambiguation page. < - > Indeed we won't need to make more of a summary stub out of the disambiguation page, together with the nice disambiguation table that I referred to.
Embrace those people who are positive, avoid those who are not and be the inspiration for those with dreams #inspiration < - > @julianleybourne Agree wholeheartedly Julian. Someone who exudes negativity consistently while going about their job will eventually poison the entire well and ruin both culture and motivation
It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense. < - > So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good, I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede, even if only a very minimal mention, so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits.
*HUGS*  But I'm sorry. < - > i'm so sorry!
Put it up and we'll go over it. < - > Provide a link to it and I'm sure this crowd will weigh in.
What about including Republican presidential candidates positions on Energy policy (that have tea party movement backing)? < - > Herman_Cain_presidential_campaign,_2012#Energy_and_the_environment with related Herman_Cain_presidential_campaign,_2012#Global_Warming seem to be the most related currently.
Question 1 probably should be amended to state that Obama was factually wrong when he stated that he went to a Muslim school. < - > Concur on that William.
I can never get sick of James Arthur's Back from the Edge album. Such a masterpiece. < - > @YourEzraMiller Agree 100% #JamesArthurBestFans
I missed my Ginchy. < - > I for one have missed you much, though I'm sure there are plenty more who have as well.
#NationalWalkOutDay Rock it, kids, and don't stop. < - > @StephenKing I agree
"It's a problem we can't ignore."  Peak law body says the justice system is 'shameful' https://t.co/dH3lDFJWnE https://t.co/3EeQDglhgL < - > @3AW693 I agree it is absolutely shameful and harmful
A more accurate word to describe the process that you (and yes others) ascribe as deportation is in fact forced (death) marches - after rounding up and uprooting people from their homes (and mostly after the males in the population had already been removed and dealt with by other means (primarily direct massacre). < - > I agree that the term used be ''forced (death) marches'', for infact that is exactly what was used by the Ottoman Empire.
Bugger the vampires, Annie and George are why I watch Being Human. < - > I forgot to add: Annie and George were why I watched, too.
SO CUTE < - > so fucking cute.
Yeah, I'm up for it, as long as I don't have to start today .. < - > I might just do it...
I don't think you can have friendship without honesty. < - > The truth hurts sometimes, but that doesn't make you (or other people) full-o-shit jackasses for saying it.
Editing via back-and-forth revision and simple talk-page discussion usually suffices, and avoids a bureaucratic bottleneck that freezes contributions. < - > You are right!
The snapshot of the arguments has been presented by the proposer of the RfC in a simplified and misleading way to the extent that the well was poisoned. This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. I propose that editors who have been contributing to this page work together to find an alternative way to reach consensus. < - > Comment - I agree that the wording of the RFC was innapropriate and inclined towards yielding a hostile response. It failed to present the reason why the criticisms are notable despite the fact that they are only available for scrutiny in what are determined to be 'fringe sources', and that some of the critics (Eysenck and Ertel) are not astrology-sympathisers but offered independent assesments of the study whilst holding positions of academic authority outside of astrological circles.
As you are no doubt well aware, Wikipedia is not censored. < - > As to your points, I agree that wikipedia is not censored, but maintain that this article seems at best a very unusual place for that uncensored nature to be a problem.
Gap is indeed participating in the editing of this article. < - > Now we know that Gap edits its article because the ip address is registered to the organization.
45 years ago today... https://t.co/jXhCFY9pK2 < - > @SenJohnMcCain @tedcruz Congratulations Senator! I may not always agree with you but I always admire you!

The opening sentence was worded as follows ''In classical mechanics, when an object is observed from a reference frame that is rotating about a fixed axis, the motion of the object can be determined from Newton's laws by introduction of fictitious forces...'' This a very vague and ambiguous, to the point of being meaningless. < - > This makes it all sound very mysterious, by introducing these strange things without saying where they came from.
SO CUTE < - > SO CUTE!
So did the Master in the pink dress. < - > The pink dress was epic.
lol she's so funny XD < - > Hahhahah.
Good luck. < - > good luck
film nerds weigh in...which is better < - > to the one person who voted, i agree
In so far as the acceleration associated with them is in every way real, the discussion (which sometimes arises) about the reality of inertial forces themselves must be considered as aimless. It is only possible to talk about the difference between the forces of inertia and the forces of interaction between bodies.'' < - > I completely agree that discussions about the reality of [fill in the blank] are aimless, because there's no clear scientific meaning for the term ''reality''.
Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric - yes, fair game. Barron and Tiffany, no. https://t.co/tgcYQ8zI6k < - > @JHowieJr Totally agree.
But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan, Letterman, Ferguson, or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now. < - > conan is hit or miss but damn funny when he hits.
They tried to put me on the cover of Vogue but my legs were too Long - @LucianPiane Shot by @Ash838MG https://t.co/Ivvl2kkAap < - > @iampoojabatra @LucianPiane @Ash838MG I agree with you.....  Once I saw you in Delhi Sheraton Hotel Lobby around 2000..... I had realized that day that with these long legs...Vogue needs to increase their cover size. But they are not listening. :)
but yeah everyone hear jokes that ''super girl'' has to always be androdgynous ''bu nan bu nu'' lol it's so true!!! < - > even her voice sounds guy-ish XD At least this year's has a pretty and girly sounding voice.
An hour just doesn't seem long enough to fit it all in. < - > I read that it's supposed to be an hour and fifteen minutes, which helps a little, but there's still so much to resolve.
Utterly shocking. This is why I don't take it seriously when people get really mad at me for referring to Laura as X23. Because to Marvel, she'll ALWAYS be X23. https://t.co/FzE5mFgwzD < - > @SalSaysWhat Why would anyone get really mad at you for anything comic related?  I'm excited for this and i agree, there was no way Laura was staying as Wolverine.   Now can we get rid of Jimmy Hudson wolverine please and thank you?
The two aren't really comparable, though, are they? < - > It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics.
To whoever gets my liver when I die, I am totally ok if you have a couple of drinks. Seriously people need to get off their high horses. < - > @deemadigan AGREE!!!!!
is it enough for you !!! What about your basic needs ? https://t.co/2At1ZT670S < - > @Roflkher_ Haan bhai i agree bhot problems aur hai. But i still remember in 2011-2012 onions were 200 rs per kg and so were tomatoes. Aaj petrol 80 ke neeche nhi aa rha yehi bologe. But atleast pyaaz tamatar 200 nhi hai. And shayad those are the basic needs
I'll take a point today. < - > @BlueNawaz I agree.. as long as it's 2-2

You don't have to be mean to be funny, you just need to turn that hate inwards and be self-deprecating. < - > @muyrando I agree. But I use a different system. I redirect all my hatred at any whatever version of Microsoft Windows is one revision behind the current one. So right now I hate Windows 8.1.
I don't care who Trump hires or fires. I HIRED Trump to do that job &amp; I'm happy to let him do his job.  What weakens America are democrats resisting and obstructing this administration because they lost an election.  I can't wait until Schumer is replaced!!! #VoteHimOut #MAGA https://t.co/o2yynTLVMo < - > @polishprincessh @RealMAGASteve I agree with Hanna.  Schumer is the one with the record of undermining America.  Let Trump do the job he was elected to do.
Any who...your presense has been missed. < - > I missed my Ginchy.
Oh no, I'm so sorry. < - > aw
I tend to agree that this image is fairly disturbing - the body is partly decapitated and there are flies all over the head and torso. < - > I am rather upset with the current image Image:Civil War graves.JPG This article should be mainly about the science of death, and its ties with human culture secondary.
#MAINE  If you know any Dems in Greene or Sabattus, we NEED A DEM CANDIDATE BY 3/15 to run against this GOP garbage, Leslie Gibson.  PLEASE HELP ASAP  @StephenKing @IndivisibleBang @LCIndivisible @mcm_ind @indivisible207 @MaineDems @Everytown @ACLUMaine   https://t.co/9yBGQSnJbu < - > @KottiPillar @StephenKing @IndivisibleBang @LCIndivisible @mcm_ind @indivisible207 @MaineDems @Everytown @ACLUMaine Agree let's take this abuser on. Make him crawl back in his hole.
the pictures of him in the grass look the most legit i think. < - > I like the grass pics as well.
Improved with legit citations. < - > At least two of the citations are to scholarly works, Im not sure about the others but I'll check.
Few pre-game thoughts. Lineup is gonna be interesting tonight. If Iniesta is fit to start, I doubt Dembele will. I'd prefer him over Paulinho though, but I think Valverde thinks of him as a bigger risk. < - > I'm not sure how much I agree with that, because Paulinho too has shown that he's prone to losing the ball, and more importantly, adds little to creative parts of the game. We'll know soon enough though.
Each incident should be analyzed on its own merits, not on the popularity of a phrase. < - > I fully agree.
The quote would be more at home in our 'since 1900' section. < - > Any failures of mine notwithstanding, I'd be OK with moving the quote there, after the paragraph that mentions Harris and the other New Atheists. It would have the beneficial effect of removing recentism from the Etymology section.
Australians are unhappier than we were in 2017, says a new report. Do you agree? #9News https://t.co/zUTmAdhtWV < - > @9NewsAUS No, I do not agree. This new report should repeat again, using the different procedure and methods. I am delighted to announce that 2017 was one of my golden, optimistic and valuable year in my entire life. Throughout 2017, I've proven to myself how much potential I do carry.

I took a bite and had to stop myself from yelling ''oh my god that tastes like pussy'' < - > I hate the taste of Bison.
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump I agree
so yeah, i'm in! < - > You know I'm in  ;)
Not only was it very POV, but it wasn't even formatted properly. < - > Okay.
Based on my research and your research, we need to include certain specific facts if we want to tell an accurate story in the article. < - > There's still important background missing.I will have another look at Kamen today, and possibly make a few tweaks.
Using whole child development to grow emotional intelligence https://t.co/nsbeaL8sJw | Edmodo < - > @schoolsontap I agree with a need to raise EI.  What isn't clear is in practice how a person or org. can clearly determine that EI has in reality been boosted.  How do you accomplish this when there's many different EI inventories to choose from?
All 3 of my kids chose for themselves to participate in #NationalStudentWalkout today. Very proud of them. This was a part of their education, not a break from it. < - > @PreetBharara @Lawrence I agree. Students attending this event and participating and real life politics should get a credit not detention.  The pretty sorry reflection on the administrators of our so-called schools.
I also need to move him down to the bottom car space so Ena can use the park next to the entrance. < - > Makes sense to have the small car at the top where people walk past.
I tried it again last evening with a little cinnamon and a bit of ground cloves. < - > ..oooh, cinnamon and cloves sounds nice.
Something I think we should be promoting as #physiotherapist #AHPsintoAction #WeAHPs https://t.co/8hHowVShPN < - > @M_Leephysio Absolutely agree
Most cases of what we perceive as ''disorder'' has little if anything to do with entropy, and hence little to do with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. < - > Crystalisation, planet formation, and many other thing s that seem to increase order still increase entropy.
"I think Sam Darnold is a bonafide No. 1 pick."   @joelklatt with his NFL Mock Draft 2.0: https://t.co/Tw3OnPedSW < - > @FOXSports @joelklatt I agree.  I'm from SC, but I watched him all year and was amazed at him.  He'll be like the rest of the greats and take a couple of seasons to get used to the NFL, but I'm sure he will be one of the greatest ever.
Some advisors and experts believe that due to a few millionaire 50s born clients &amp; the likes of a female PM who can suffer the loss of 6YRS state pension income, the rest should suck it up.   I don't think so.   #FightOn < - > @jannycat Straw man argument building!  That is not the case at all.  I am no advisor and expert but I do know a few and they have given me and our members a great deal of support.  Most just agree that men and women should be treated equally.
The majority of editors involved here had an other opinion.-- < - > Just to remind that in archive 8 part 14 and 15 we discussed already the word ''terrorism'' and it was clear that the majority support it.
;A; I thought that was a guy! < - > Wow she looks like a boy :O
Everyone needs to assume good faith and not get into strange contentions about the possible POV-ness of other editors. < - > I apologize for my behavor, I also assumed good-faith until I was falsely accused again by another edtor from this article.--
I'm sorry to hear of your loss, my condolences to you both. < - > Hugs to you both.
And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. < - > Roland was quite right to point out that facts and theories are different.
I still think in the back of my head though, I really would have loved to have seen Devastator come to life. < - > Here's hoping we'll see Soundwave, the Contructicons, and maybe even the Dinobots in the next movie.
nope. https://t.co/s7RWRI8ZXF < - > @_cole_marie_ Agree
ill take 2 < - > haha oh man I need one of those!
So I think for the overall betterment of the article we should leave out the gore. < - > The argument, as we've made, is that there are already more than enough war pictures - there is more to death than images of people being shot dead in a war.
It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
b's to pick up my awesome toothbrush!! < - > wow, thats badass, it has a leather pouch too.
So yeah, their outrage over ''fairness'' is highly suspect when the only thing it seems to track consistently on is the person on the receiving end. < - > I'm on exactly the same page.
There was a very broad consensus to change the article title which expanded the inclusion critieria. < - > Indeed there was a broad consensus, but to be more precise, it was to make the title NPOV and to bring it into harmony with the existing inclusion criteria and existing contents.
::pout!:: You're just trying to ruin my fun! < - > Yes...I am!
That and a hell of a lot of his parents' money. < - > I have, and I enjoy thinking about it with great frequency.
I've heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery, and being a Disney movie I don't see how it couldn't, but I'm betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind, and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation, but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once. < - > It's not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments, but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon.
Mint anything is nasty af https://t.co/wG8CWEyXsB < - > @MikeGodly_ @_joshuaaaaaa I agree hate mint
@EngineCommerce Enjoy your info and data on e commerce very much. Why isn't there discussion on the back story of e commerce? Mfg. W/O mfg there is no product, thus no e commerce. It's equally innovative and just as challenging, i.e. new methods and new technology. < - > @GP82845 Thank you for the response! We do not discuss manufacturing because it is not our expertise. But we agree 100% it is vital. What are you're thoughts on the history of manufacturing?
Yesterday Barcelona hammered Chelsea....!!!!!!! (3-0). Chelsea got humiliated by one player and that is Lionel Messi.....!!!!! Post match reaction...!!!!!!  watch the full video  https://t.co/PqYj11I6GD  #BARCHE #BarcaChelsea #UCL #ChampionsLeague https://t.co/AWY8BasGnF < - > @angry_rantman I agree to most of the things u said but honestly I didn't feel humiliated with this loss bco atleast we should some intent. Real humiliation was against City when we r playing to limit the damage. For me that's a disgrace.
Traffic slow because of people and their curiosity, rubber necking at a snails pace. Perhaps emergency vehicles need to have large privacy screens to block other motorists from seeing what has occurred? Just a thought. https://t.co/tWmpkbVc0F < - > @PigSpotter Yup I agree they need to use the screens I've been stopped on the highway by traffic unfortuanely I was like right next to a body that was hit by a car.... Cops there but only let people through one at a time. I will nvr forget that twisted torso and face scarred for life.
There's something I want to get off my chest after seeing a few specific tweets in the thread that's still going by people who weren't involved in the drama, but are just diving in because they like to hate someone's work rather than the person himself... < - > ... 1. NOT every single fan of the Nostalgia Critic thinks he did nothing wrong. I know plenty who are absolutely aware of what he did and do agree it's dumb. They just mainly keep in mind that most of what he did isn't as downright awful as Michaud, and watch his show because...
A note saying an alternative version is used in Scotland could be added. < - > Ok. I'll have a crack at adding the note.
The bigger problem is when people attribute other major perceived group differences to individuals, based exclusively on skin colour. < - > And I would absolutely not dispute that claim.
The Haaretz is a reputable source, it's more pro palestinian than most israeli newspapers, has been called antizionist by some people. < - > yeah, sorry my reply was to him, not to you, i've tabbed correctly now Haaretz is definitely reputable as a source to use on Wikipedia.
Unprostrated https://t.co/M5gdnjaZ5q < - > @GeorgeMonbiot I have found I do not always agree with your opinions, but I respect your committment.  Today I gained a new respect for your intellect and bravery. I tip my sombero to you @GeorgeMonbiot
The gift that keeps on giving. https://t.co/lxHnsX8N05 < - > @PrisonPlanet ask every democrat if they agree with #Hillary.
I want them deleted and replaced with non sensitive photos, can I have a seconder. < - > I will second that.
The current wording strays into areas which can lead to inappropriate interpretations, I see no good reason for this awkward wording. What is wrong with the sentence ''Atheism is the position that deities do not exist''? < - > Perfect. I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence. I move to replace the first and all paragraphs in the introduction with that sentence.
He done changed the game. https://t.co/ItsA5Gm3AS < - > @BenHowe I agree DLST all the time would be good or keep on standard with no changes.  Let's forget about springing forward or falling back.  This is a ludicrous tradition that I think we can do away with now.  Call your Senator and ask him/her to vote to stop changing the time every year
I'm sure many people would appreciate it. < - > I'm sure a lot of people appreciated that being gone.
Just saying... feel free to re-tweet and borrow! #smallbusinesslife https://t.co/fLVvOTgGUx < - > @Finale_Shoes Totally agree
The original wording was off base, as I believe are the comparisons to Katrina. < - > I'm afraid ''Obama's Katrina'' has all the hallmarks of a senseless political meme, like calling everything ''-gate''.
Before going into details about the use of fictional force, it is essential that when typing in ''centrifugal force'' Wikipedia users do not come upon an article that suggests that it can only mean a fictitious force (''rotating reference frame'' is ambiguous for this issue, since mapped rotating reference frames are also used in Newtonian mechanics, without any fictitious force). < - > I agree that this article should not state or imply that the only meaning of ''centrifugal force'' is the ''fictitous force in rotating frames'' meaning, not that that is the only context (within classical mechanics) in which the term ''centrifugal force'' is used.
I like being negative as fuck. Because when positive shit happens, you're even more surprised. < - > @deadmau5 AGREE
I have done that recipe just make sure you have a BIG mug as it tends to flow over, well mine did but it is really tasty < - > Big mug, yes: I used a one pint measuring cup (which likely holds .5 l when all is said and done), and it was fine.
Conjures up some beautiful imagery. < - > I love the imagery and the use of personification.
Song of the South should be released again. < - > yes, at every point.
I`m listening to Franz Ferdinand right now <3 < - > I love Franz Ferdinand <3
This is a lovely piece of poetry. < - > great job!
Ok so twitter just locked my account &amp; forced me to delete this tweet https://t.co/Xwyggl276b < - > @TRobinsonNewEra just tweeted this...I agree we should cover christian terrorism equally to show how barbaric Christianity is. now i will wait and see if the same thing happens to me.
The unfortunate truth is that we've killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check (like we did with deer and moose, etc). < - > But I can also see that this is a situation that us humans have created with overfishing and the like.
...I really should go see about getting into NKU and going into art history, shouldn't I. < - > IMO, art history > actual history, sometimes.
This stream starting to get boring cause they not talking < - > @MrAdamWhite69 I agree
What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture. < - > Strongly support.
im svts stylist now < - > THE PEOPLE AGREE!! https://t.co/X3TiQMDzh3
68, that is, hands-down, the best version of the lead ever! < - > Indeed!
I hate them, hate them, hate them. < - > That's what I want to do.
I agree to a point RE:Duffy; I don't think he needs to be named and the opinion of one historian should not carry undue weight.Nothing wrong with ref 17; shows a variety of sources...you can't write simply from the POV of the church as an institution is always in the right...they screwed the pooch on how they handled the abuse cases as well as the lies they put out whenever a Pope dies.-- < - > Therefore I don't think the unsupported comment by Duffy has a place in what is already a quite lengthy section.With regard to the Mexican points, these will have to be checked.
No interpret here, just know how to read English. < - > English may the problem then.
I think this is a fine proposal. < - > How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''.
Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding. < - > I agree with that.
I don't remember this being an issue before the injury... Even if no one on the training staff sees a correlation https://t.co/UILtvdT6ca < - > @csl_duke Yeah I totally agree. One of the key things about gripping a ball is the the pinky holds the bottom of the ball.
When the whole world was against you, Sikhs fed your starving children. Today, your actions have defeated our humanitarian purpose. Sorry to say... but we have no grounds left to defend Rohingyas https://t.co/LRbbTp09Jk < - > @mssirsa @KhushuRK Manjinder Bhai I totally agree with you and I think Hindus and Sikhs should completely unite and fight for the rights for victims of 84 sikh massacre and Kashmiri pandits we both share great history ..
That episode was so terrible, my head is still spinning from it's suck. < - > It's like RTD looked at Last Of The Time Lords and thought, ''How can I be more ridiculous than this?''
I didn't like the new Avenger's movie < - > Yes, the new avenger are so terrible. Zak sneider made an awful film.
I dont like the way Putin reigns the country! < - > I totally agree with you! His new polytic is terrible!
I saw the new MacBook Pro. It is so thin and powerful! < - > Yeah, the apple can make great products! I loved it too!
Lamb up by 95 votes.   Oh, please, benevolent forces that be, we can't stomach an arrogant pompous con man bragging that he was the difference.  We just can't!  GO BLUE #PA18 < - > @mjfree I agree!  Just when I think @realdonaldtrump @potus can't say anything more stupid.............he does!  The campaign rally in Pennsylvania (which was really all about him as usual) made him look like an even bigger CLOWN than he was before!
If Wilf dies, I will be inconsolable. < - > There'd be public outrage.
Bush article contains the word ''criticism'' ten times, twice in the lead. This article only uses the word once, in the trifling matter of the Nobel Peace Prize. < - > I agree with OP.
VISIT ME MORE OFTEN IT MAKES ME SMILE < - > AND SERIOUSLY, COME VISIT ME.
I dount if any available pic far away too 1000 years ago,a slaughter scene from Sparta War?-- < - > Regarding pictures from long past wars, there obviously won't be anything in the form of a photograph, but there plenty of paintings etc.
I would suggest something like: ''The Roman Catholic Church, more officially termed the Catholic Church...'' < - > Xandar is correct.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > The sentence at the top is close to the reworking that I gave the earlier sentence, and I agree that it can be improved.
Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history, would be more appropriate, avoiding the problems of politics, over-attention to recent history (there are three images related to recent wars involving America, any more than one is too many) and preferably not so gruesome. < - > I am for your remarks--
Well, here are my two cents about what to cut (based on what seems out of place for a lead, not based on any numeric target for length): 1) sentence starting ''Previous names'' (none of these are in wide use today), 2) sentence starting ''HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells'' (too much detail for the lead), 3) somehow merge the paragraph starting ''Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS.'' with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections, antiretrovirals, etc (I'm not as sure about how to do this one). < - > I certainly agree on the previous names; not needed in intro.
Excuse my ignorance, but is this a legal requirement? Surely not all accused are extended the same courtesy. https://t.co/0FEqXOMm8H < - > @journojohn Agree with you whole heartedly, but due to who #Zuma is, #Shaunthesheepabrahams is trying to show a form of respect. He should not even have done media before speaking to #Zuma, could have called him this afternoon and then face the nation. #arseaboutface if you ask me
Realistically, a gun control plan that has any hope of getting us down to European levels of violence means confiscating guns. https://t.co/nirOebrPEz < - > @voxdotcom Realistically? Hahaha. Confiscation would be totally impossible. There are too many guns in the world and most of them are made in America. Even if you got everyone to agree to a voluntary gun recall (won't happen), where would you put hundreds of millions of firearms?
How do you feel about patio drinking, BECAUSE I FEEL GREAT ABOUT ITTTTT < - > i LOVE patio drinking.
I LOVE the fit of Mathieu on the Panthers.  But there is just no way we will have the cash to throw at him that he wants.  Way too many teams out here throwing out stupid money.  He will get paid a lot.  Unfortunately, it won't be by us. < - > @jamos14 Anything is possible. The numbers on Breeland's contract are in, heavily backloaded, he wont cost us much this year. But I agree, it is unlikely. What a nasty secondary that would be though... wow.
Well I wish you had, it would have saved me the experience of crying while curled up in the fetus position in my bathtub. < - > Of course in my case it was my eye - but it doesn't take a genius to figure out if it hurts my eye it's going to hurt your bits
I don't think that keeping close tabs on students' activities is a violation of privacy because schools have students' safety, both physical and virtual as number one priority, therefore safety measures in place such as monitoring are essential to keep safety #lesson9 #educ307 < - > @zdravkorvasilev I agree that students safety is number one! but, instead of monitoring their every moves, another way could be to block certain websites that they don't want the students to have access to.
I don't think you can have friendship without honesty. < - > I'll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with.
Pie is a bottom tier desert. Somewhere higher than plain donuts and jello. But not above oatmeal raisin cookies.  #PiDayHottakes < - > @_David_Edward I actually agree wholeheartedly with this, especially given bulk quantities of oatmeal raisin cookies.  Pie is fundamentally about sharing, and I hate that.
i love them, so so stylish and a great pallet. < - > Your work keeps getting better and better...
lol although that really tall girl was REALLY pretty (and Li Na was even prettier but she was eliminated early on) ..I didn't like her though < - > Li Na was my fav XDD She was so cute!!!
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. < - > @realDonaldTrump That's not exactly correct, is it? The Republican side of the House Intelligence committee has come to this conclusion. Not the full committee. And truthfully not even all of the committee Republicans agree with this finding. That's not saying much for you. Hurry up November!
If I have a fact with the appropriate citation, I'll add it without consulting anyone here or ''beating a dead horse''. That is appropriate according to the rules. < - > Yeah - it's pretty simple. You need a WP:MEDRS quality reference for whatever you want to add (unless it is completely uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged...eg ''The sky is blue'').
The suggested changed text also indicates that the genocide continued after 1918,and also explains that ''Great Calamity'' is a phrase that is only used internally by the Armenian communuty. < - > So while I appreciate (and agree with) the points you are trying to make - lets not fall into the trap of accepting (essentially) denialist (and false) terminology.--
:)  Good luck! < - > Congrads for excaping, and good luck in your new home!
MODERN ART RANT WHERE < - > I want to see this rant...like for srs.
but my youngest sibling was 12 and I think it was rough on him. < - > 12 is such a fragile age!
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > eh, ya aint too bad
Obviously the box thing helped protect Wilf from turning into the Master, but surely there must be something else, considering that the TV was talking to him. < - > Yeah, he's definitely got a bigger part to play in this.
Or maybe it's 3) Dudeman, at 85, is confronted by the fact that many of the people who serve the same Holy Mother Church, people he knows, quite possibly, people in whom a great deal of trust has been placed, have engaged in a massive, heinous conspiracy. < - > I could see 3, certainly, but I don't think there is a massive heinous conspiracy going on.
Someone castrate this fucking asshole https://t.co/hK61eXJm4m < - > @hayleeglo I agree with you
It's the memories you make with the music. Bit of a chicken an egg scenario @alinabrooks but yer the music at the moment sucks heavily < - > @dannybrooks69 Yeah, I can agree with that, because I relate memories with particular songs! Haha yes very true, nothing like the good old classics ey?! @dannybrooks69
Name a movie trilogy where the third movie was the best. < - > @JonNegroni several I can think of where the best is the last but have more films than a trilogy.  only 1 I can think of thats a trilogy and thats the Hannibal trilogy. not many if any will agree with me but I much prefer Hannibal Rising the most
Is it okay if I add you? < - > Yeah!
Thinking about all of the digital footprints that I have created overtime kind of creeps me out.. really gets me wondering about how "private" everything in my life really is. #Lesson9 < - > @jessieneiman7 I agree, just googling your name can bring up so much stuff online from the past that you may not even realize is still there. When i googled my name, my myspace account came up and I don't even remember the last time I signed in there.
This article is blatantly written from a Marxist perspective. < - > However, I have a problem with this: ''profit is what is received, by virtue of control of the tools of production, by the capitalists'' This needs work since it is about ownership, not control. Perhaps there is some Marxist bias here.
These badly need a merge into a single centrifugal force article. < - > I have some sympathy for the idea that a single article could probably encompass all of the more-or-less related concepts that go under the name of ''centrifugal force''.
how mental can you get? < - > That's crossing a line.
Getting help for a substance abuse issue is a sign of strength. It cannot a disqualifier for getting a job.   There are so many good reasons to torpedo Trump nominees. This is not one of them. https://t.co/a0p4HQw79X < - > @Spacekatgal I totally would agree, however in relation to security clearances it's a factor that shouldn't be off the table when assessing a candidate.  Particularly issues of nat. security, public health and safety. Not saying it's an automatic disqualification but it has to be assessed.
Thought that was too big a coincidence. < - > Yeah, definitely.
17 people die in a high school and a month later there's a nationwide protest to get the attention of lawmakers.  One dog dies on an airplane and there's a bill in the Senate rectifying it within 48 hours. https://t.co/YISKBPgtkS < - > @wxdam Like I agree completely that gun control should be out in place but the issue is that people will oppose such laws and thus it is difficult. Meanwhile who the hell is gonna oppose a rule that literally stops dogs fromsuffocating and nothing else :P
Yes, either of those would be better than 'pre-Indo-European'. < - > We could say the only ''indigenous non-IE language'', at least for W Europe.
The Salon reference is not about Hamas, but about Hezbollah in Lebanon. < - > No, the Salon article was about Israel making the 'deliberate close proximity to civilians' charge against Hezbollah during the Israel-Lebanon conflict in 2006.
Bethers, ima so sorry to hear the news. < - > i'm so sorry!
Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.'' Have at it! < - > (ec) I l do ike the idea of starting that sentence with ''Today, ...'' That does help frame the historical context well, implying current, but perhaps transient, notability.
Gorgeous! < - > This is gorgeous!
The difference is Heath Ledger died and there were almost immediate conformations of cause of death. < - > Agreeing with Bookkeeper here, also, this notion that we must give the masses what they want to read on this latest 'scandal' is completely wrong.
Time for the Minister of Commerce to start turning up to work. While sub-contractors are going broke waiting for the protections Mark McGowan promised them a year ago, Minister Johnson spent 49 days away from his portfolio since his appointment. #getonwiththejob #wapol < - > @PeterKatMLA barnett called it dog eat dog and thats why the laws were not changed after contractors went bankrupt in the schools program.agree needs to be changed now.better late than never.
The blame is squarely on religion. < - > I understand that their religion played the biggest part in it.
The cake will rise over the top of the mug, but don't be alarmed! < - > I have done that recipe just make sure you have a BIG mug as it tends to flow over, well mine did but it is really tasty
Young Americans in the 1940s fought for freedom. Young Americans today fight for "free" stuff.  Smh. < - > @WalshFreedom ??? Joe, I usually find myself on the other side of the aisle from you but that doesn't mean that I don't respect and agree with the majority of your opinions. You have my sincerest respect. That being said, I have no idea what you mean with this tweet. Fighting for free stuff?
if i do, im going to try my hardest to spit on his face. < - > right on,
It's irrelevant for the classification of the language. < - > The addition also seems rather long for the content it adds.
I agree that the article needs more on the Church throughout the world, but in a much broader way than has been proposed here - mission work, for example. < - > and another 5% to issues in Canada.
I hate how underrated Earl is fam. His lyrics will go over your head < - > @Shansdoe thats young phenom. i agree

WHO legally defined native people as children, Church, Governments? < - > I agree with you that we should check the source for the ''children'' comment.
Taking this into account, I'd suggest that the wording be changed to: The deliberate Bombing of Guernica, a city of 5000 - 7000 inhabitants, by the German Condor Legion was considered a horrifying attack in Britain and the United States. < - > That works.
(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV. < - > User:DoctorEric, I agree with your assessment. Having a section on the ''Dangers of religions'' within an encyclopedia article seems as if the article is being written to push a particular point of view.
A friend of mine once said ''If being honest means risking a friendship then so be it.'' < - > well being honest with some people is good.

Why is it that we admire the young &amp; beautiful, when our elders are wise &amp; beautiful? 1/2.. https://t.co/Z9ZiImAOxC < - > @bishopborn56 I so agree! I took care of my grandmother for the 4 years before she died in my home. She was 98. I loved her and the experience of having her in my home!
I think many (MAYBE most) writers would prefer the former be a function of the latter rather than an expense of it.  And if forced to chose, I'd reason the a healthy majority would select "writer" insteas of "seller" if they make enough to live.  But that's just debate points. https://t.co/W1EO4K7ZUf < - > @EdLatimore I agree most writers would prefer it be a function of the of the latter, but the best seller list shows different.  If your writing was worse and your selling was phenomenally better, would you sell more copies?

Biola go and sit down.   Just because he put ball inside Curtois toros doesn't make him the greatest ever.   I have put ball inside your toros before what am I?  Until Messi wins the World Cup he is not in the same league as Pele, Maradona, Zidane.  Case closed. https://t.co/XFYF4qScck < - > @Chxta I usually agree with everything you say. Not this.

Social media is a tool to social change, not a main expressway. Discuss face to face.  #rgcmtalkback < - > @Cotten_Kaylie Yes, I agree with your opinion. Face-to-face communication can always bring people a kind of sense of security and trust. #rgcmtalkback
There are two that are way out of left field, and I can't even start to guess how those different episodes are going to be tied together. < - > Oh lord, you're right when you say you can't even begin to string the episodes together.
This article is way to American-centric. < - > I agree, considering that technique has been used for a long time and in many different circumstances.
I'm feeling sort of ambivalent about part 2 because part of me just wants to figure out what the hell is going on but the other part doesn't want the regeneration to happen and knows that I most likely won't be satisfied with some of the explanations RTD has to offer. < - > I agree with all of that.
It's irrelevant for the classification of the language. < - > A (very) brief note (maybe a single sentence) might be appropriate, but a whole paragraph seems to be overkill on what is, essentially, a forgery (from what I can tell) and not, in the end, relevant to the issue of describing the Basque language.
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump You know the real culprit here? Nambia! That country has no respect for the economic sovereignty of other countries. Nambia dumps steel everywhere. Impose a tariff on Nambia today! No more Nambia products!!! Re tweet if you agree!
It's beautiful!! < - > And yes the new print is so gorgeous!

Cybercast New Service is not a neutral source. < - > Yes, we shouldn't base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction.
Were you at the Dunsworth's annual Canada Day party, by chance? < - > Woahhhhhh Yeah, that's where I was!
Obviously the box thing helped protect Wilf from turning into the Master, but surely there must be something else, considering that the TV was talking to him. < - > Yeah, he's definitely got a bigger part to play in this.

Disgusted by menstruation: No Considers it to be an achievement: No < - > When a woman goes "You will never understand what a woman has to go through." I agree, because I don't want to understand and I am not the reason why you are going through whatever you are going through.
To my understanding, if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence, then that notion is considered a scientific fact. < - > As Emw says, the notion that HIV causes AIDS is supported by overwhelming amounts of evidence and is not disputed within legitimate scientific literature.
The generation of today is easily influnced by every aspect of society and through social media. Politicians should listen to what this generation has to show and give for the future. #p1olys < - > @RobbenAudelo I agree with this statement because you make a good point about how there are more political influences and how these affect the current generation filled with social media and such.
It just really yanks my chain that some stupid americans would be so self-righteous to think that we would give a shit about their petty protest, even though they have contributed more to destabilize the planet than any other human act. < - > But I still enjoy a Big Mac...as for the Americans, I'm getting pretty ticked off with them lately.
That's kinda sad, but cool at the same time. < - > That's great!

Glee is losing my interest, it's all about the pretty white kids. < - > I was thinking exactly what you were thinking about Glee.
But this article should be perhaps changed to 'Armenian Genocide Theory' or 'Armenian Genocide Claims' in order to neutralize the article. < - > I agree with Rokkafellah, the name of this article should be 'Armenian Genocide Claims', but I know that the subjective writers of this page won't change the name.
 < - > Aw, being sick for end of the year exams is the worst.
Yeah, that and the fact that they say it in their charter: [T]he Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise, no matter how long that should take. < - > The prevailing opinion of Hamas among laypersons is that the group has a vested interest in ''Killing All of the Jews'', in part due to the fact that the US and EU have declared it a terrorist group.
I feel lucky to have known Stephen Hawking. His work is an inspiring reminder of what human minds are capable of. < - > @BillGates I agree. Too bad there isn't one single intellect in Washington DC to carry on thinking for a living.
*does Sudoku and falls asleep* < - > sleep-age is what you need
Each incident should be analyzed on its own merits, not on the popularity of a phrase. < - > I fully agree.
This is a list of topics which have been characterized as pseudosciences. < - > I'm reasonably OK with this position too, if it turns out to be the consensus position on the scope of the list.
It just really yanks my chain that some stupid americans would be so self-righteous to think that we would give a shit about their petty protest, even though they have contributed more to destabilize the planet than any other human act. < - > I am so mad about Americans this week, I could vomit with it.
Maybe one could ignore it for awhile, but boredness with the lack of intelligence would set in sooner or later. < - > Intelligence and beauty are certainly plusses, but when it comes right down to it, what I'm really looking for is someone who's kind, honest, sincere, trustworthy, loyal, and who loves me.
America's schools, the left's propaganda mills https://t.co/iK5VG2JiFx < - > @marklevinshow Only too true. Many of us noticed this in the early 1980s &amp; were dismissed repeatedly over the years. Now the LEFT is so strong with such a stranglehold on public Indoctrination factories they boldly act in our face because they are confident people either agree or no one cares!
It's really pretty!!!!!! < - > How pretty!
Sign Tyrann and save Douglas and Worley for Dime Packages https://t.co/sMIqJTvomJ < - > @hardROClife I agree man!!
Roy Keane: 'The manager was including the Charity Shield as a major trophy. My God, you know you're in trouble.' Agree that was more embarrassing than the 'chair' quote the other night. #mufc < - > @samuelluckhurst Agree Charity shield is not a big trophy, but u don't get a chance to play in charity shield if you don't work your socks off and win PL or FA cup previous season. You have to work hard to play Charity shield.
Beautiful calligraphy https://t.co/XNYuFx2dWH < - > @Freakytrickys I agree.

Popular lore would have the SJ as equivlent to a PhD; that is Jesuits are educated to the same level. < - > One of the reforms of the Council of Trent was regarding education for priests so we should have something - I think - in the article that establishes the Catholic Church requirements - even if it is to the bishops discretion up to a point which I think it is.
Wake And Bake Brethren, Take Cold Beer And Suck Brezz fam.... How I Pray My Day Turns Out https://t.co/ZMGGLiaWsI < - > @OtunbaBillz I agree with you but only the brezz part
The kayaking around there is best left to experts, though - the Falls kill a few people a year. < - > I actually have no wish to kayak as I prefer rafting, which I do at least once a year.
Can we please stop the bickering? < - > Well said, my friend.
Point taken about New York and Jews; in defense, I'd say the difference here is that the perceived (and actual) character of San Francisco is more inextricably bound up with its larger-than-average share of gay, lesbian, etc., people. < - > New York City doesn't mention that it has the highest percentage of Jews of any big city in the lead, Philadelphia doesn't mention its predominate Italian community.
Fact: improving employee engagement has a direct correlation with improved #customerexperience https://t.co/FpAntffYNn < - > @MaximGrubyy @kanwalgabru Yes, absolutely agree. And as a matter of fact it could be false. Example, my order from @amazonIN was supposed to be delivered@11 am yesterday with additional shipping cost and it hasn't been delivered till 1:00 pm today.
Stop reading your slides! #conferencelife < - > @QuantumTessera Quite agree. It is impossible to deliver a proper harangue if you just read the slides.
Sorry, thought you meant some of the ''positive atheism'' stuff. < - > Well, the positive atheism stuff is probably okay to be restored as well, but I'm a little uncomfortable with the sourcing in that section.
oh snap. < - > Awesome!
There is presumption (logical and statistically supported, but still presumption) of HIV infection as the cause of their deaths.This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are ''tiny'' (a subjective term). < - > It's obvious from statistically valid sampling that HIV is highly prevalent in people with AIDS in Africa.
Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.'' Have at it! < - > (ec) I l do ike the idea of starting that sentence with ''Today, ...'' That does help frame the historical context well, implying current, but perhaps transient, notability.
No, it hasn't been agreed upon by all users yet. < - > The majority of editors involved here had an other opinion.--
I am OK either way. < - > I think the sentence is good the way it is; it shows that the church, while believing itself to be the ''one true church'', also wants to work with others on common goals/for unity.
Richard Powers is a brilliant writer, isn't he? < - > Yes, very much so!
or would we have to delete all sources older than 6 months ago? < - > I'll admit that is funny, and also quite correct.
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr Trump, don't forget to tell your people how much the USA are dominating the global market, threatig 3rd world countries to agree to unfair trade practices, unfair prizes, unfair working conditions, unfair dumping exports, killing thousand of farmers in India and elsewhere
Everyone wants to defeat @narendramodi without telling us about their vision of India and how they plan to fight corruption. < - > @vivekagnihotri @ravsd88 @narendramodi I agree with you .but I hate u since u r supporting kangana
Would ''Consequences and applications of finiteness'' cover the entire section adequately (for all practical purposes)? < - > Fine with me.

#NelsonMandelaBay #NoConfidence  Trollip says the move by #EFF will only give them short term gains but in the long run, voters will reject them < - > @POWER987News @Bass_Mad Agree. The EFF behave like children, throw their toys out the cot and throw a tantrum when things dont go their way. We all know what society thinks of spoilt brats !
I'm satisfied with Severa's proposed compromise.-- < - > Ok, I will support this move.
I'm so sorry, sweetie. < - > I'm so, so sorry to hear that.

We must remember all the kids and children who have been killed or injured by gun violence, whether in school or out. #ENOUGH #NationalSchoolWalkout #NeverAgain #GAGisWatching https://t.co/CaeyVIZw2r < - > @GAGnoguns It is extroidinarily sad. We agree.   Do you have compassion for the children and people whose lives have been saved by guns? Aren't those lives equally valuable?   A gun is a tool. How it is used all  depends on who is holding it.

Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes'' 1 he has signed in to law a tax on tanning, as well as buying cigarettes (which are bought overwhelmingly by people making less than 250,000) 2 These facts should be mentioned, I think, because they have caused some controversy among his opponents, and some supporters alike.Long story short: We'll know he raised taxes on under $250,000s if and only if a reliable source says he did. < - > During his campaign, Obama had pledged that ''no family making less than $250,000.00 a year will see any form of tax increase.'' This was violated though when he raised the cigarette tax by 156% in April 2009, a tax that effects people below the poverty line.

How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''. < - > Not a bad proposal.
Dear @Eagles fans. The team can NOT sign every former player or star player cut by other teams. That Is ALL! #WednesdayWisdom < - > @TonyBrunoShow @Eagles Bruno taking over for Steven Hawking in the brains dept!! Totally agree!!
This! Is always driven me nuts when people refer to ticket numbers, verbally or in Git commit messages. https://t.co/FwuPW1ddyA < - > @tobylyte I think you likely need to use both, since the tooling is generally able to pick up the ticket id and do some automated things with the ticket, and provides some traceability. I agree though, that the main bulk of the comment needs to be about the reason for the commit though.

I think something definitely deserves to be there in the lead. < - > I agree; ending with just landmarks is bland.
Biola go and sit down.   Just because he put ball inside Curtois toros doesn't make him the greatest ever.   I have put ball inside your toros before what am I?  Until Messi wins the World Cup he is not in the same league as Pele, Maradona, Zidane.  Case closed. https://t.co/XFYF4qScck < - > @Chxta Even if he eventually wins the World Cup , I am sure the next argument will be he has to leave Barca, spin  and play in other European league before you will agree he's the best football player in our time .
I'm not sure a note on the CoA field is possible. < - > I've come to the conclusion the format wouldn't allow for one.
I find that country scary, it's one of the reasons why I wouldn't like to visit it, nevermind live there... < - > Well, I agree.
Judging by my timeline, last night has lost Jose a lot of support from a fair few Reds!

Personally witnessing https://t.co/VZGG7RoBKp < - > @MaryamNSharif I agree,  civilian superamcy has always been a topic for the analysts and academic scholars,  but surprisingly it has been largely picked up by the public, this shows people trust what Nawaz Sharif says
The reason I challenged Levine's argument is because I thought it made no sense. < - > @Sifaka - As you suspected, you misunderstood what I wrote; probably because my language wasn't clear.
They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative. < - > I don't think any other religion article breaks ''origins'' away from ''history'' and I don't think they should - the two terms are synonymous, and they should be discussing the same things.

#walkupnotout asks students to take responsibility for the mental health of their classmates, suggesting that school shootings are *their fault* for not being "nicer." It's victim-blaming.

Those parents belong in PRISON. https://t.co/i5Vao1Ej8M < - > @Chamberpaint I agree they are reprehensibly negligent and should be punished - but given what goes on in US prisons : the deleterious regressive impact of incarceration -they end up worse as people , and the exploitative toll on taxpayers - I favor non penal consequences
That is to say, I think that willful ignorance about the fact that different groups of people from different parts of the world have different features is far more pernicious than simple stupidity or ignorance. < - > Yes, given that both the options you compare include ignorance as a component, I won't argue too strenuously.
I hate #polystyrene it should be banned. Its worse than a plastic bottle in my opinion.

The article does not address them adequately; especially as an FA article. < - > Yes, this article plainly needs more of that sort of thing.
Right now this part of the article is grossly misleading. < - > In my opinion, since the number of casualties is really unimpressive (as compared to the WWII events), we hardly can discuss it at all.

So here is the dilemma: if the standard usage of centrifugal force is used, as in the present article, the result is an article consonant with the vast majority of the literature and with the common use of ''centrifugal force''. If instead the formulation is used, then (i) immediately one has to make the subject more abstract to get across the idea of generalized coordinates, and (ii) immediately one has to issue a disclaimer that this viewpoint is not what is commonly understood by centrifugal force. < - > Apart of that, as Frugal correctly states here below, a discussion of fictitious forces certainly doesn't address my objections to the current article as stated at the outset, as it is a wrong intro for people who type ''centrifugal force''.
This was my last gift to her, and I miss her already. < - > You did the right thing.

Anyhow, sarcasm aside, the suggestion that Hiberno-English has a different word for British Isles is crazy and a clear attempt to impose yet another unwanted POV on this beleaguered article. < - > Anyway, I agree with your comment above regarding the suggestion of a separate word in Hiberno-English for the British Isles. Unless references can be found it should remain out of the equation. As a speaker of Hiberno-English I can assure you the term British Isles is a common term for these islands.

This quote also comes from the institution that has done the most research into the matter and adds to the professionalism and credibility of the paragraph and article. < - > ''Dictated'' leaves out valid facts, and once again, the article is more credible with the quote.
- Well, I can't speak for Wikiscient, but I assume it's for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly: The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image: this is not death in general, it's the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image, another very specific case of death. < - > I don't really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier (though again a more ''neutral'' John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better).
I hate to say this, but I try not to let personalities get in the way of facts. I'm furious with Corbyn, but in the case of the poisoning incident I think he's right to urge caution until we've seen the evidence. This govt has amply demonstrated that it simply can't be trusted. < - > @ajhanlaurence Whilst I agree about being cautious, I think he exploited the chance to make party political points at a totally inappropriate time. For me, that was his biggest mistake. Neither the time nor the place.

They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative. < - > Re the creed, I have always believed that removing its explicit presentation would be a good thing if space demands suggested it (as it does here).
It is much longer and omits the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse.Wassupwestcoast, there are some serious flaws in your new rewrite, references numbers 225 and 226 do not support the sentence they reference and number 226 is not a news article, it is an opinion piece which are not OK refs in Wikipedia. < - > I wouldn't emphasize too much the '' the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse'' because there are still new cases coming forward.

How about: The deliberate Bombing of Guernica by the German Condor Legion in April 1937 contributed to widespread concerns that the next major war would include extensive terror bombing attacks on civilians.[2][3] The articles on the raid and the Condor Legion discuss the differing estimates of casualties. < - > I support it.--
Having conversations on eljay, when we're both on MSN! < - > me too
I agree. < - > Hence why I said we should wait for the court ruling agreeing with the administration's argument that the mandate is a tax.
Troy I'm sure the Browns knew of Joe's decision. Solder wasn't a slam dunk. It's not that simple. https://t.co/tx6vN476UC < - > @egoldie80 I applaud the Browns for not overpaying for anyone.  Solder's salary is ridiculous and I'm happy with the two OL we were able to get.  And I agree, E, so many people think it is so easy and it's not.  These guys have 31 other sales pitches.
I know we already talked about this, but I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers. < - > All I can say is good luck, and you're in my prayers!
your pictures are gorgeous! < - > Gosh, your pictures are perfect.
Yule is almost upon us all, and the more pagan-minded among us should remember that Yule is the ultimate excuse to stay up all night, preferably get tanked, and have a huge scream-fest outside in the bitter cold at dawn. < - > Being the more pagan minded amonst those who actually know you IRL, and live 10 blocks away, this would be a good time to mention that we do stay up all night, drink, celebrate, and what not.
It occurs to me that the Harris quote is not the only part of the text that deals with issues other than the origins of the word. In fact, there is considerable discussion of how the word has historically been used as an insult. In that context, Harris' turning of the tables, as it were, seems to fit better. < - > works for me.
the comments on every animal video there is someone trying to find a way that what happened in the video is animal abuse i swear to god < - > @nendoggo I can appreciate suggestions on how to properly care for animals or explaining how a situation might upset the animal, but I agree. There are way too many people looking to stir crap
NOOOO. < - > No...
you are clever the panty lines are distracting on yer booty which i am, super jealous that it is not my booty. < - > ohhhh baby your cuuurves
As there seems to be some confusion amongst those who voted to Leave the EU:  I don't want another referendum - the first one was rubbish!  I want our MPs to do their duty &amp; act in the best interests of our country based on the evidence now available.  #BrexitReality #SaveBritain < - > @spaceangel1964 I agree the first one (June 2016) was rubbish. My problem with relying on MPs is that hard leavers won't accept a decision and cause riots. #Article50 should be challenged in court and overturned, or be subject to a proper #FinalSay  #StopBrexit #ABTV #WATON #FBPE #follow5001
Have to block you sir. C word thoda Jyada ho gaya na? https://t.co/EahAFCiKz6 < - > @sardesairajdeep Agree. Completely avoidable
Longest 15 seconds of my life! < - > craaazy.
Nope. (By which I mean, I'm not into it. Be more helpful, bartenders.) https://t.co/Hsf6RTp38i < - > @phil_cook I agree with the "you need a decent sized sample to know if you like it" but you only need to have a sip to know you hate it.
Instead of the painting (which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull, although I think that the painting is very fitting. < - > I don't mind if we lose it.
.@TheFarahKhan believes every actor has a different approach towards the craft. #Bollywood  https://t.co/fRj1IcVGfQ < - > @FeminaIndia @TheFarahKhan Yes I agree...
The older I get the more I realise that my maturity peaked at 11. < - > @Caspar_Lee Im turning 21 in like 10 days and I seriously agree lol
Imagine if they had cast Jeff Goldblum as Grey in 50 Shades ... < - > @AliciaMarieBODY @vef76 what do you think? Something tells me you might agree a little
I am so sorry. < - > Ahhh bugger dude.
Would you like to see a film that, for pure information and interest, exceeds nearly anything you can name or have ever seen? < - > Scary!
I'd like to give a shoutout to some really cool people that I'm fortunate to have met over the past year! @Gerarddeane97 @Behemous @EgoSenatus @qbreek @SWBFExpress @DylanDoDon @ManuelDuarte24 @MTMovieCritic @AlphaPlank77 @RalphHallMusic @ColdSystemX @fuzzymed4287 @WhyItMatterz < - > @noahnolsen @Gerarddeane97 @Behemous @qbreek @SWBFExpress @DylanDoDon @ManuelDuarte24 @MTMovieCritic @AlphaPlank77 @RalphHallMusic @ColdSystemX @fuzzymed4287 @WhyItMatterz You're too kind. We don't always agree but healthy discussion is great. https://t.co/HW4LjHksFU
Even if it's just a sentence or two under Domestic policy (subject to expansion in the future if he takes more direct action concerning the spill), it should at least be mentioned. < - > While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.
If this article is in fact the primary among the four (which I would think it would be) then it should just be named centrifugal force, with a hatnote for the dab page. If, on the other hand, the four articles discuss truly different things and none of them is clearly primary, then centrifugal force itself should be dab page. < - > Your proposal about disambiguation makes sense.
The best approach to Putin is not any kind of military aggression, but a police operation. He survives on money laundering and underworld connections. This isn't war, really. Or counter terrorism. It's fighting organised crime, like Mueller < - > @peterjukes Agree. Strip the Kleptocrats of their booty. I genuinely would  like to see Sergeant Nick Bailey be given the proceeds of the sale of one of their homes. This is not enough  https://t.co/l1Ml44n9tT
Do we all agree that the pro-life image should be changed to Image:Pro-life protest.jpg? < - > I'd support that change.
I keep reading reviews comparing last weeks SPN to the game Clue ! JUST NO. it was a homage to noir films. Hell the main characters were named after the lead actors in the Maltese Falcon! < - > @SuperWiki Totally agree. Obviously a lot aren't as old(or young!)as we are and I loved the noir feel to it, even the costumes had the Maltese Falcon feel.
On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths). < - > Shlomi's right that the earth won't overheat so long as it can continue to radiate in infrared into space, but there are mechanisms for trapping heat on earth - the greenhouse effect is the major one, and in our case, the biosphere is another obvious one.
very nice! < - > that was really cute
i mean heres just my 2 cents but i feel like no one actually cares about people saying nigger like cmon it lost all value over the year (atleast in my opinion) i just see this as an attempt to forcefully talk someone bad (whether its justified or not isnt important) https://t.co/EwVaHUw7V7 < - > @reiichiiii I agree. Even black people use it and people that complain about stuff like that are mostly not even better and use similar/the same words as well.
*HUGS*  But I'm sorry. < - > I'm so sorry.
I agree that going forwards the tree diverges, but that does not indicate a universal common descent, but rather indicates a mechanisms of evolution. < - > Move forward and the tree diverges, it doesn't converge.
I think if I ever had 5 truly pain free minutes my body would go into shock... < - > @Polipetl Have to agree on that from personal experience.
For someone complaining about piping links, you don't check them. < - > I'll admit I did not verify the links' accuracy before trying to fix them.
This is important for those who think Wynne is their friend. She's hurting small business to gain some votes. #onpcldr Let's get behind the new leader and stop bankrupting our kids. https://t.co/qXWdIEtWPI < - > @LarryBermanETF I don't get your point.  The min. wage wasn't raised sooner, and your angry about that?  I agree.  Sooner would have been better, but it doesn't negate the fact that it is needed now, and will be good for the economy in the longer term.(all being spent on goods and services.)
Think about it. We required the Federal government to enforce businesses serving Black customers. Why? Because businesses almost universally refused Black Americans service. They had nowhere to go. No options.  That is what this is. Arbitrary banning of a singular group. < - > From a libertarian point of view the government had no business telling businesses who they could serve. In theory, I agree. But it became such an oppressive standard no other option was available.  That is where we are right now.
I'd support that change. < - > I like agree with GT's idea, to use the first image from the first row, and the last from the second row.
Wow. Want to feel optimistic about the future of our country? Watch every single second of this incredible speech. https://t.co/HLGnrdyzDH < - > @mattmfm Agree! When I heard this speech, I got goosebumps! States will see an economic impact in 5-10 years based on their support of the #neveragainmovement These are soon-to-be college choosers,  homeowners, etc. #PurchasingPower
i really should do it. < - > I might just do it...
Now granted, a job that wouldn't phase an extrovert will often suck me dry and I have to go home and do self-care for sometimes quite a while before I'm recovered enough to handle the rest of my day, but I can do it. < - > Yeah, after having to encounter a ton of people I just want to GET AWAY and it's not really understood in American culture where being quiet and wanting to be alone is supposed to always be a cause for concern.
Yes, < - > The bodies of militants were found inside, it added.
Hugs for all of you. < - > *huggles*
United Just doesn't get it, again and again. Let's put the flight attendant in the overhead bin. https://t.co/HEvrImHe2w < - > @JMfreespeech Finally we agree
Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding. < - > I agree with User:Hypnosadist.
I mean, if you think of ''the Devil'' as ''the personification of evil, or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil'', and sex abuse is evil, and the coverup of evil is evil, and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican, then, well, yes, the Devil is at work inside the Vatican. < - > ''The devil is at work'' may be Churchspeak ''people are doing bad things''.
As fears grow over the impact of Brexit, a new poll finds SNP support has risen since last year's General Election and support for an independent Scotland up on the indyref. https://t.co/InnUc9mkvq < - > @SaorAlba59 Even after the UK gov and ScotGov analysis both pretty much agree there is NO scenario of brexit where we are better off, there's still a significant minority who don't seem to know this, or do not want to admit it!
Have to run off to Play.com to get myself a copy right now. < - > Yes, by all means go get a copy.
i need to see that again to remember how bad it was ;D < - > it's so bad and yet..
"We're asking for fewer prayers, fewer words, and more action."   Students in Washington, D.C., march to the Capitol and rally to demand gun reform. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/s8X2mteJmz < - > @MSNBC If you agree with their message or not .. every American should be proud that the youth of America is making their voices heard...They are our future leaders.. to debate openly is what makes America great
Hamas engages in it, period. < - > I agree that Hamas is a terrorist organization, but terrorism IS subjective.
That Will character is so dodgy, the way he used Cristiano tonight wasn't nice... the vibes aren't good from him #FairCity < - > @faircityfans Agree totally. Another psychopath in FCity.
I hope it's seen as an improvement by all - I think it brings in some more of the concepts that are important. < - > I like what you've done...
If Tory Lanez want some good album promo.. he'd pull up on Fortnite and run down on Travis Scott in the game. < - > @IamAkademiks Agree! All promo is good promo. For all the new fans, check out @DFlowetry new video.   https://t.co/53ODd1NaWJ https://t.co/5OZRGlDWR9
Perhaps the RfC/message to WikiProjects after posting your proposed change here will garner the wider scrutiny you seek. < - > Provide a link to it and I'm sure this crowd will weigh in.
Any artist can place anywhere on any chart as long as they have enough music components in a particle song that would involve that charts primary genre. < - > Her singles could even appear in country charts, but that does not mean she is a country singer.
Yes, Be Bold. < - > Gee, I thought the general principle of WP was to Be Bold.
This looks like a worthwhile link as a reference for the paragraph, which presumably should have ''open systems'' changed to ''isolated systems''. < - > Might make a suitable external link, however.
With that in mind I would propose to replace the original text between brackets above with: ''The bombing and total destruction of Guernica by the Luftwaffe's francoist ''Legion Condor'' is widely considered as the first systematic terror bombing aiming at totally destroying a urban centre, specifically targetting the civilian population in order to demoralise the enemy, and the main precedent for the widespread use of such terror bombings during World War 2. < - > Therefore the suggested corrections make a lot of sense.
I love this, especially the first five lines. < - > I agree that the first five lines are wonderfully unique.
Being a being who has spent a good deal of her life interacting with the world through books, writing, and the internet, physicality means very little in my interest of someone. < - > Ah, the ''why'' -- because fun conversation remains fun longer than beauty remains entrancing, to me.
Episode was very beautiful painful but beautiful  #YehUnDinonKiBaatHai < - > @forever_rishu Agree
It is not racist. < - > yes, at every point.
In 2014 it was not just about own vote but the effort to get atleast another 5-10 votes for @BJP4INDIA, do we see it happening now. < - > @anilkohli54 @BJP4India I agree, everyone go out and ask for vote...till membership drive they keep momentum...
Sorry Martindo, the talk page is the precise place to float a controversial change, not the article itself. < - > A sandbox is another good option for complex/large edits.
I never thought I would miss Connecticut quite so much. < - > It's one of the only places I have ever felt truly at peace.
-- The Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, called Trump a "F*cking Moron" and kept his job.  -- Tillerson then condemns Russia, and he's fired.  -- Moral of the Story:  Vladimir Putin is calling the shots, not Trump! < - > @EdKrassen .@EdKrassen   Something tells me that narrative will never be spoken publicly ever. Nor will Conservatives agree or Progressives do anything about it.  Perhaps, maybe, just saying, sorta kinda, possibly, in a round about way...  ... New people with new ideas are needed. https://t.co/UfoRrX5GvH
As a Doctor/Master shipper I can confirm that it was pretty exciting and I genuinely thought for a moment Rusty would throw in a kiss, in a flurry of Master-Insanity and Christmas cheer. < - > Seriously, the next episode needs a kiss.
Lot of things are happening in #ChengannurByElection campaign vis-a-vis BJP. All the things done are mandatory. What's the extraordinary things have been done? < - > @jothishnair1010 Chengannur may throw up new challenges to BJP. Hope a united party and parivar outfits will rise to the occasion. Vijaya Kumar is not a usual Congress candidate. I agree he has his disadvantages too
Still, how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples? < - > I was so confused by this episode and it actually hurt my head a little bit.
I choose plain and utterly brilliant because sparkling conversations and learning is smexy. < - > All other things being equal, I'd take the intelligent plain one over the dumb beauty.
we sure need to secure our schools and save our children but a new gunlaw will be counterproductive < - > @TedNugent I agree ted
lol........really??.......you serious??.........you're going to take that position??........''definition'' or not.........(Geneva Conventions were created by Politicians)......you're going to justify dropping bombs on city centers and in the middle of civilian populations by saying they're ''military targets''???....this position may be accepted by international POLITICS........NOT the average person............to find the references for that.........ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK........anyways........I know this section is about defining ''terrorist tactics''........you obviously would like to use ''international political definitions'' when it suits your position (as you just stated) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted (as stated above with the U.N. < - > In fact, I support it.
Glee is losing my interest, it's all about the pretty white kids. < - > and as for 'glee', yeah, i lost interest in that  a couple of weeks ago too...
I just can't believe the leaders of the corporate world can be so staggeringly naive. If you're going to be an evil capitalist, at least have the gall to act like an evil capitalist. But you want it both ways.... https://t.co/afkB6AqAcO < - > @jordanbpeterson This is something @profwolff, @noamchomskyT, and @NickHanauer can likely agree with.  @JeffBezos and @elonmusk need to be aware too, the few engineers we have at the top, can have the vigilance of what Adam Smith crucially described as "the vile maxim of the masters of mankind".
U cannot counter ravish Kumar and Vinod dua level propaganda with infographics and Data. < - > @indiantweeter FULLY AGREE!
Seriously, it's good to know you're out there. < - > Glad to hear it.
I love the teddiesss ;u; Which colour did you like best? < - > <3) The teddies are so sweet...
I'm more than any tag team can handle. Those titles will look good around each giant shoulder. #MonsterAmongAll #GetTheseHands < - > @BraunStrowman Yessss i agree
So beautiful! < - > and beautiful pics by the way.
I especially like the environment in this one! < - > The whole thing is gorgeous, but I especially love the details on her dress and the crashing waves.
...and church of ''Christ'' is not ''Christian''? < - > I agree the term ''Christianity'' is too broad.
I hope you feel better soon. < - > hope you feel better!!
"Dark times" are defined by people who wants to dim the very light that dug deep to the corrupted roots of society. You speak as if you speak the absolute truth and what's right but the manner u face opposing ideals and arguments isn't consistent on how you want to be perceived. < - > You can say how clean, decent and smart you are right now, but you can never be considered as perfect as your narcissistic self wants you to be even after this time. Your idealistic views are rotten to the point that it destroys everything that doesn't agree with you.
I truly loved the 1st series when it was shown here on BBC America. < - > It's still really, really good.
Djathinkimacowboy, your behaviour seems odd to me that you ask for help, I give it, and you ''in general...agree with the action'' and then start this discussion to complain about what I just did. It kinda puts me off helping you again. < - > Yep.
@Connor_Jones0 love the person u picked for the face claim he's pretty awesome :) < - > @magicisreal1993 Aww thank you he is yeah, I agree there
Everyone says it's stressful and awful, but I LOVE it. < - > i absolutly love being in a new place.
A law-abiding Idahoan who owns an AR-15 should be able to argue her or his position without being falsely accused of violence. As Democrats and their allies push gun bans, gun owners have a right to speak out. #idpol < - > @IdahoGOP I am a Dem who supports 2A.  With the right to own a gun comes a responsibility. I am for gun safety and gun violence protection.  Can we both agree on that?
As for VirusMyth, any ''wealth of scientific information'' should be found in reliable sources. < - > I completely agree.
A more thorough explanation would be appropriate perhaps at Presidency of Barack Obama. < - > I think the whole section should be deleted from this bio entirely and moved to Presidency, and would applaud consensus to do so.
Sadly, no, that's right inna middle of something else I'm doing on Saturdays - but there'll be other movies to go-see. < - > Sorry you can't make it, but, yes, there will be others.
As the industry moves along, are we looking forward to a new generation of "It" models? https://t.co/efk3dnMOE9 < - > @Fashionista_com Do you think this could be due to the fact that there are so many bots on IG now? I agree with the micro influencer data, that the model with the real interactions is considered the "it" girl because followers crave real interaction.
Regardless of your feelings towards the game or who's involved.  Tonight, Ninja, Drake, Juju Smith and Travis Scott just set the next milestone in the industry.  Combining global stars in a FTP BR Game on Twitch. This is amazing exposure for Gaming/esports/content creators. < - > @iMStokes_ @MonkeyTraderTV Couldn't agree more this is globally showing that people who play games to enterain and also play games on a pro level can be successful
Lawmaker's tweet after physicist Stephen Hawking's death draws criticism https://t.co/DYdgUrMugz < - > @FoxNews I agree.
He'll be 30 come the start of next season, but Willian has enough God-given ability to stand him in good stead for another couple of years &amp; he loves playing for Chelsea. That's a cocktail we Blues supporters love. First priority to keep hold of this summer imo. https://t.co/46HcPxnvol < - > @gate17marco I'd agree mate, Hazard too. People can coat him off over last night but when he's a very good player, difference is Messi is an amazing player. Most players look insignificant when sharing a pitch with him.
The problem in Wajir is a national one not just for that county.  #WajirNiKenya #WajirNiKenya #WajirNiKenya #WajirNiKenya https://t.co/l23dHj7yxN < - > @Aabubakar382 Then the leaders must listen to the concerns of the non-local teachers. Embrace them, protect them, as you build capacity to take up these positions. I agree it is a national issue with help from the local community, it can be addressed.
YES PLEASE https://t.co/hdQdD1eWxZ < - > @SeclusiveBlue agree big big agree
hope you feel better!! < - > Good luck on exams, and I hope you feel better soon!
1% may be accurate over all of the Inquisitions, but I think this will need to be made more clear, since the previous sentences detail the Spanish Inquisition.I disagree with the change also, I left a note on Xandars page. < - > And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we're talking about.
https://t.co/ZnKXDIhAdz < - > @PapaGio64 i agree on this
If you believe the account of Adam in Genesis is metaphorical, how would Jesus have direct lineage from a metaphorical person? < - > @carobini Not that I agree with this, but wouldn't they say that all humans have a common ancestor?
As it stands, I would accept ''the regularity of his initiations with the United Grand Lodge of England has been disputed by some'' as a safely NPOV compromise. < - > I agree that there is a problem and I thank you for pointing this out.
I'd suggest replacing ''Dangers of Religion'' with something along the lines of ''Atheists' Criticism of Religion'' and then appending a similarly brief subsection titled something like'' Religious Response to Atheists' Criticism''. These are somewhat unwieldy headings but this does seem to be what is being discussed. < - > @JJL - I think your suggested titles are better than any suggested so far (including what I had in mind).
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > Ditto Xandar.
Let people see this delightful movie thats full of morality stories and great songs. < - > yes, at every point.
life is good. < - > so great..
So beautiful! < - > Gorgeous pictures!
So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct. < - > It seems uncontroversial to say that 'The USSR joined the Allies' - the 'Allies' of World War II were a temporary grouping which wasn't centred around formal treaties.
We're apparently supposed to fake it. < - > FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT or whatever that really annoying expression is.
I don't understand how some people can sleep without a glass/bottle of water next to them. < - > @Tish_Twin_Dolan Totally agree!! That is probably why I have to pee so much while I am sleeping...lol
Received complaints of Class 12 CBSE Accountancy paper being leaked.Asked officers of Directorate of Education to investigate&amp;lodge complaint with CBSE: @msisodia, Delhi Education Minister and Deputy CM < - > @timesofindia @msisodia They donot agree to remove additional subjects because the private schools want to earn profit by making students forcefully take up additional subjects such as physical education, fine arts, Foundation of information technology etc. I have also suffered of this kind of case.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I'm not sure how ''prominent'' it should be, but the lead should certainly reflect the new data.
Jeremy Corbyn is an English Lion https://t.co/Tu2omSqqhS < - > @chunkymark Agree with every word!

I'm a sex addict who'd do it with my clone I'll make the world open their eyes to see that's just masterbation and not being gay! < - > I love it!
Hamas makes no pretense of targeting the military - blowing up in a bus or restaurant in the middle of a city has no military purpose, just a civilian purpose. < - > I am trying to explain WHY I have come to the conclusion I have......please show me the same respect and try to do that as well.......instead of......lol.....saying I don't understand the difference between ''intentional'' and ''accidental''.....because I have addressed that earlier as well: telling the population of a civilian area that you are going to bomb/attack and then going ahead with your attack whether the civilian population leaves or not.....is INTENTIONALLY TARGETING CIVILIANS since: 1.You are FULLY AWARE of the civilian presence.
Much love to you both, and to Loiosh and Shampoo. < - > Hugs to you both.
We took our country back. < - > I'm glad that I can now stay put and have hope for the US.
The picture does not illustrate any specific point to advance the article. < - > But upon further inspection of the article I have noticed two other instances where the pictures do not coincide at all with the topic being dicussed to the left.
Worst service ever. Serenata Flowers failed to deliver 2 days in a row. @SerenataFlowers < - > @myselfhelpspace @SerenataFlowers Shocking service from Serenta Flowers fully agree with you
Yes I agree, as I made clear (I hope!) before: also in Newtonian mechanics objects can be ''observed from'' a rotating reference frame that is however mapped to an inertial frame; thus without introducing any fictitius forces. < - > With these additional changes, I believe your concerns have been met and suggest the banner be removed.
Overall, however, very well done: fun, some genuine laughs. < - > I loved the movie despite the exaggerations and innaccurate accents..
I understand your frustration but there's nothing that can be done about it. < - > No legitimate suggestions of article improvement, just hand-wringing about ''liberals'' and SAT scores.I find it all over Wikipedia, but especially in the political arena, whether it's a politician or a political commentator or whatnot.
your b&Ws are always the best. < - > nice shots!
'Fraid I exhausted them. < - > I think you exhausted their minds more than their bodies.*g* They are used to physical exertion (basketball & track are tiring).
this ninja guy did not get bullied enough in high school < - > @nothappyman i agree with this
oh snap. < - > That is amazing.
yay. < - > In total agreement!
To consider an appropriate inclusion of this sort of opinion, we would need to see a preponderance of mainstream reliable sources talking about it. < - > The consensus in the news is that it isn't Obama's Katrina yet.
new list...... us thank you look the reason hesitate one and only you < - > @lovkyg i agree
I want one. < - > haha oh man I need one of those!
Hopefully, I've succeeded in compiling a list of all the images of abortion-related protests currently hosted on Wikipedia, so that we might pick and choose from among them. < - > I agree.
I never thought I would miss Connecticut quite so much. < - > I miss Connecticut too!
How can y'all watch somebody play the game? lol I must be playing < - > @TyYoShoe I know whatchu mean lol , i agree.
BigHit is still a company that needs money to operate.  Constantly sending 7 boys+ staff, makeup artists, guards, dance/camera crew, etc, around the world to SEE US, which isn't free. They give us SO MUCH for free &amp; some out here crying when A PORTION of that is paid content. < - > @dailyunnie I agree with you. Some people here are so immature. BH is not forcing them, so if they don't want to pay a shit then they should leave and sit fucking down at the corner.
He played well but I would have given it to Edmilson. https://t.co/utexBhooNl < - > @KsModiba I agree with you..He won every ball...broke every attack I wonder how they judge man of match

#Innovation is driven by a #process of rapid exploration and discovery. @GrowUrStartup @MikeQuindazzi #business #innovation #Management #DigitalTransformation #success https://t.co/fFRmfGyr08 < - > @antgrasso @GrowUrStartup @MikeQuindazzi Agree. A first important step, and would add, that without execution it would not be an innovation at the end of the day. A discovery cannot be accounted as innovation. #entrepreneurship is critical!
It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense. < - > So be it.
I'm still confused by it all although John Simm in a dress made up for some of it. < - > rofl, he was working the Naismith daughter's pink dress.

No interpret here, just know how to read English. < - > English may the problem then.
RACHEL AND I WERE SAYING HOW VHS THIS IS LIKE ITS INCREDIBLY VHS I CANT EXPLAIN IT IT FREAKS ME OUT HOW VHS IT IS https://t.co/AxHQx22nxZ < - > @sleeptilljune @_WAVELIGHT_ yall I hope you agree
It just requires so much more concentration then sitting there cruising with traffic < - > You dont really save time lane jumping and usually just increase your own frustration.
The doom and fear here is doing my mental health no good at all; but the many people with snippets of beauty, joy, inspiration, nature, art, literature bring me such peace. I don't know what to do, my brain is screaming at me. < - > @lapetitepie I agree with @teddy_red, a break or a cull will do you the power of good. Follow a few positive accounts too. I'm really enjoying the posts on @PrecisionHomes_ that are full of hope and innovation. Whatever you decide to do, we'll still be here waiting for you, my lovely friend
@WaxPaulNow  Come on!   This needs to be completed ASAP! < - > @19740b We couldn't agree more! Visit https://t.co/3yRGjR2kE7 to learn how YOU can get involved. Together, we can badger @MadameTussauds into reason.
Nonetheless, we seem to have acheived a consensus: more illustrative images would be a good thing, but ''shock'' pictures will not be accepted unless the article somehow directly concerns such images (e.g. < - > Anyway I agree with the consensus reached here; I just wanted to offer my opinion anyway.
A more thorough explanation would be appropriate perhaps at Presidency of Barack Obama. < - > Until then, it is better covered under Presidency of Barack Obama and BP.
.@TheJuanWilliams: "I don't think it's very American to torture people and neither does John McCain who was tortured." #TheFive https://t.co/LuhRSKMI1M < - > @FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams There is a huge difference in torturing "people" and torturing "terrorists".  At least say the correct words, Juan. You never agree with anything the President says or does.
Convention https://t.co/Zbe1DltsD6 < - > @vsurywanshi87 Whatever her parents agree to
Support: seems like a reasonable compromise. < - > Support: We are not here to adopt doublespeak and newspeak, even when advanced by the US.
The best part is that her shoes have little tiny cleats. < - > I liked Molly, but since two (?) of the neighborhood girls had Molly, and another had Felicity, and another later got the ''You'' doll...
This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama. < - > Agreed, unless it's miraculously over due to this new top-hat, or buzz kill, or whatever procedure, we're only partway into a very long and complex event that will almost certainly involve the President further.
This would be a completely useful list, rather than the mess we are working on now! < - > I agree that this list should become List of pseudosciences and use WP:PSCI but note that there will always be grey: you cannot avoid it.
I've certainly found the URLs useful in the past, and there's no real advantages to removing them. < - > Agree with SimonP above, Regards, --
Our cheer sheet says that it's ''We are the Pink, we are the big number one'' but I've always thought it was ''We are the Pink, we are the pink number one.''  I'm so confused! < - > It IS ''We are the Pink, we are the PINK number one!'' Don't let them lie to you nyach!
If they want to go let them go.   Less bs to deal with. https://t.co/awKAjkyieB < - > @Rainbow_Nuts I agree except that Australia has an indigenous population that is systematically discriminated again, and killed at genocidal levels. They do not deserve more shitty people.
THIS is what led to Maplins demise...   This and poorly trained, contemptuous staff who couldn't be bothered... https://t.co/sCw0JLzTQt < - > @MechEngDad I agree, only visited a few times but on all occasions I left with nothing because of the bad attitude and high prices. I actually couldn't care less about them going bust!
We got a smarty pants big city guy with a funny name elected president, despite having everything against us. < - > It's time for someone with some intelligence.
I agree that this list should become List of pseudosciences and use WP:PSCI but note that there will always be grey: you cannot avoid it. < - > There will always be grey.
A double standard is being applied to this article and other articles about Africans. < - > I agree. 'Black,' should be a disambiguation entry that notes the word is often used informally to refer to Africans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Australian Aboriginals, and redirects to those articles.
I also wish that ''Life is short, you are hot'' was actually a reasonably pick-up line. < - > It's a fabulous pick-up line, isn't it?
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Support. I think it's fine, in an article about astrology, to report the opinions of astrologers, provided it's made clear that theirs is not a mainstream scientific view. In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
I think I am fine with it, but if we do not like having the last three headings on the same level as the meat of the list, anyone feel free to revert or come up with a heading for them. < - > Looks good to me.

Republican strategist Steve Schmidt just said it all about Trump!   https://t.co/VhPgUC3sKX < - > @TomthunkitsMind I AGREE if trump was removed today I think it will take 10 years or more to fix every thing he has done to us and to the USA if he is in for 4 years it will be 30 to 50 years if it can be fixed ever as you can not take back a nuke war and I see one coming if he stays in office
It might be trivial but I think that the sentence ''The manner of death was certified as ''undetermined''.'' needs citation. < - > Agreed.
hahaha i love this movie. < - > i know!
Shaq says more cops would be the way to prevent school shootings, rather than a ban on guns https://t.co/GFr5QH6KN2 < - > @SInow I agree to the ban not working
I think the the existence of this page is only justified as a linguistics article. It should show how the term 'black people' has been used historically and in different parts of the world for different purposes. It cannot and should not, in my opinion, try to show what the term 'really' means. < - > I agree with Martin. This article currently attempts to be an ethnological article while using a title that is supremely unsuitable.
Patriot. Not a loser. Not a draft-dodger. https://t.co/NowFt6fh0e < - > @ananavarro I may not agree with @SenJohnMcCain but I am grateful for his service and respect all who serve. It degrades is as a nation to disrespect those who sacrificed for our freedoms and to malign and mistreat their families. Specifically calling out @realDonaldTrump
I hate to sound like a harpy but someone needs to give Kornacki a tranquilizer < - > @Karoli I agree
I'd fucking love to, but I've already half-commited myself to a spur of the moment trip to NEWFOUNDLAND. < - > i love spur of the moment.
It improves on the existing version because ''Armenian Genocide'' does NOT refer to deporting and massacring - those are methods - it refers to the aim and the end result, the aim/result being the destruction of the Ottoman Empires Armenian population. < - > So I very much agree with the intent of your change - diferentiating the methods of genocide from the thing itself - my caution (and yes objection) is relying on the term ''deportation''.
Support. < - > What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture.
I love the imagery and the use of personification. < - > I love this poem.
The death penalty is barbaric and should be outlawed, but if it must exist nitrogen is far preferable to injection. https://t.co/SJvHhd1er5 < - > @DavidOAtkins Agree on both points.  I've never understood why nitrogen was never considered for such a long time.  It's probably because it's too uneventful.  There's a creepy lurid voyeurism that seems to accompany executions.
As a Doctor/Master shipper I can confirm that it was pretty exciting and I genuinely thought for a moment Rusty would throw in a kiss, in a flurry of Master-Insanity and Christmas cheer. < - > Seriously, the next episode needs a kiss.
This article currently attempts to be an ethnological article while using a title that is supremely unsuitable. The asian people article actually covers all the ethnic groups in the continent, rather than just a ''colour'' group. I think the White people article too should be moved to ''Caucasian'', since the current terminology is unscientific and originates more in pseudo-scientific racist circles than anywhere else. The linking of Africans and melanesians might be acceptable in an article describing English language usage, but not in an article describing the ethnic groups originating in sub-saharan Africa. < - > I agree with both comments for the most part.
NOOOO. < - > ouch ;o;
Here is one from Obama's Oil Release Leaves US Vulnerable in Emergency: Fred Upton, who was first elected in 1986, discussed the decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. < - > Okay.
What's good for the goose is good for the gander. When teams stop asking for pay cuts &amp; releasing those that refuse, then players can stop asking for more money when outperforming contracts. Telling me that's false equivalency will fall on deaf ears. https://t.co/UIzD3R03Cf < - > @corryjoel A contract is in place and it should be honored it is what you agree to and it's binding.   Teams cutting players by attempting to force a players and for a pay cut is wrong (morally) as they can just buy them out.   This scenario justifies Gronks action, which is sad.
It might be trivial but I think that the sentence ''The manner of death was certified as ''undetermined''.'' needs citation. < - > Agreed.
Christmas is ridiculous. < - > christmas is putting a huge amount of stress on me and causing so much anxiety.
Well done to all our friends @barnshospital and to @BarnsHospCEO's team. Huge amount of work rewarded here in this rating. https://t.co/qYnC4kDRYP < - > @NHS_RobW @barnshospital @BarnsHospCEO I agree Rob But good #leadership is all about preventing harm by creating a good team and creating a great culture and excellent team working and good #governance.

Reddit findings...  "You'll find your soulmate when you stop searching"   REALLY?! https://t.co/ZtD8Z7nipi < - > @spacyzuma I kinda agree, the closest thing to having a soul mate for me happened with someone I wasn't trying to date.
If you have something strong opinion against the use of the word ''deportations'', then why have you not said anything during the many months that the word has been used in this article? < - > I agree (entirely) with your intent - however why fix the issue only part way?
You were a veritable prince amongst cats. < - > Rest well, big black fighter of a cat...
one direction < - > rt if u agree
I found ''Zionist Regime'' and other descriptions instead. < - > If it says Zionist regime it should say so in the quote.
TV networks are looking for the next Romo. They will foolishly only direct their search at former QB.s  They should instead hire Joe Thomas. More interested in a lineman's perspective on the game anyway. < - > @MoEgger1530 Not sure they're only looking at QBs considering FOX is pushing heavily right now for Jason Witten ... although I agree on lineman perspective being valuable
My first blog for Bright Copper Kettles! So excited to be blogging more! https://t.co/xWoMLZPVmT < - > @weejenhen I wholeheartedly agree.  A husband of a resident in Beechwood bought her a new "baby" for Valentine's day.  It was heartwarming and very sweet to see his acceptance of doll therapy and it's therapeutic affects for his wife
Contributing here is surely part of the Wikipedia editing process? < - > Point taken.
Cute kitty :-D < - > OMG the cute is overwhelming!
I'm feeling sort of ambivalent about part 2 because part of me just wants to figure out what the hell is going on but the other part doesn't want the regeneration to happen and knows that I most likely won't be satisfied with some of the explanations RTD has to offer. < - > I agree with all of that.
Ya know, 'cause they all have that damn Moe haircut. < - > Yeah, because it makes sense for an entire race to all have the same haircut.
I think the phrase should just be removed from the article, because it strikes me as a Western philosophical projection onto Eastern philosophy. it's just going to cause more confusion than it resolves. < - > Yes, I will try another wording.
cuz they are ranting about me AGAIN AHHAHA! < - > They're obsessed with you.
How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today. In recent years, abuse of minors by representatives of the Catholic church made headlines throughout the world, further tarnishing the church's image.'' < - > I think you have all hit on something with this one.
We're not allowed to create category divisions ourselves, understand? < - > I understand your point about naming issues.
i need to see that again to remember how bad it was ;D < - > yes i know!!!!
Totally sending lots of love and hugs, and support for being good cat parents. < - > Condolences and huggles for all.
See, this is why you have to move to Canuckistan. < - > It's a good idea you have there.
i LOVE the diorama with the tree! < - > handmade gifts are the best..
It would be much better to find a good, NPOV to portray the controversies (such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense. < - > So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good, I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede, even if only a very minimal mention, so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits.
I still think it's great i must admit. < - > Yes, I'm still enjoying it too - but it is a bit a of a guilty pleasure.
I know, I was talking about that skinny little arm she has would have absolutely no control over that gun. If she pulled that trigger she'd be thrown all over until the gun ran out of bullets. Get it, glamorizing the war weapon. P.S. I live in Las Vegas and was working that night https://t.co/xYBfU2tj3m < - > @realisticview1 I wasn't trying to be sarcastic. I was going to say that those guns don't require marksmanship or skill. They spray. I agree with you.
You dont make up as much time as you would think once you do the calculations. < - > well yeah
Contributing here is surely part of the Wikipedia editing process? < - > Point taken.
I think it's hardly fair to call her the Queen of RnB in 2007 just on the basis of one article. < - > i am not knocking rihanna but she is not the queen of rnb- princess of pop maybe!
Happy for ya raz. < - > Hope the good vibes keep on:)
Buy my forthcoming book. More to this story. https://t.co/eyNkhb0IXY < - > @McFaul I might. And I agree, at least two sides to any story.....
Perhaps you would care to suggest a specific addition or alteration. < - > Say specifically what you want to see here, what sources you have and make a coherent argument for why it should be included in his bio.
I would watch this sitcom. https://t.co/BuzTugT00F < - > @JuddApatow Well, going through a divorce is always hard. But I think we can all agree on one thing... https://t.co/FdFu6wHWH3
They are: 1) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2)Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative. < - > I know I don't actually edit here much but I have been watching this process closely and regardless of where they came from I actually concur with both suggestions, with the caveat that the proposed reorganization may take some effort to dovetail well.
We need an FAQ linking to the many discussions of these perennial claims in archives, so we dont' have to keep revisiting the same dead horses. < - > agreed
Doug Ford says that legalized pot should be sold in places other than government stores, Kathleen Wynne responds saying the Ontarians don't want 'cannabis sold next to candy bars.' What do you think? #onpoli https://t.co/eTGQNRQrMF < - > @TorontoStar I agree with Kathleen Wynne, we do not need stores selling marijuana in neighbourhood stores, with no control as to who is selling it and to whom it is being sold.
Well, maybe it's something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points, and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect. < - > Well, maybe it's something about winter
I am OK either way. < - > I'd vote for removing it from the lead.
GOP Sen. Rand Paul announced that he will oppose Trump's nominees for CIA Director and Secretary of State. https://t.co/lgTmpOcPs3 < - > @MSNBC Wow!! I actually agree with Rand Paul on something???? *gasps* *clutches pearls* Say no to torture!!
How would everyone feel about changing the lead to state ''Waterboarding is a form of torture (see classification as torture)...'' The advantages of this approach is that it allows those to quickly access the debate about this issue if they want to find it (as I think many of the internet traffic does), it does not push any POV and simply links to later in the page, and it links to the area that provides full support as well as details the intricacies related to the statement ''waterboarding is a form of torture''. < - > Support: We are not here to adopt doublespeak and newspeak, even when advanced by the US.
Regardless of my opinion of the tastelessness of this image it is definitely in the wrong place. < - > I agree that it does not add anything to the article.
RTD has some serious explaining to do because part one was one big clusterfuck of story lines. < - > Yeah, I don't know.
We assert facts here, even fact about opinions, but we do not assert an opinion as fact, which is what an OpEd is. < - > We don't call it a criticism or a controversy, it is simply an event that happened.
British English, hence British flag. < - > Then we are in agreement. Adding the template with the UK flag is a bunch of editors trying to make a point. It it unnecessarily provocative.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > The ''Modern challenges faced by the church'' phrasing is good.
But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan, Letterman, Ferguson, or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now. < - > Agreed one thousand percent.
I respect Stephen Hawking as a great physicist, but he was a hypocrite.   He was an Israel boycotter who contributed to an anti-Semitic movement that demeaned academia. On the top of that, the chip in the device that allowed him to speak was developed in Israel. #StephenHawking https://t.co/2SFiH5Cm5K < - > @HananyaNaftali @tpel78 Agree strongly. Like many geniuses, he was not a very nice person in many ways. His advocacy of BDS was inexcusable. I remember him for his incomparable contribution to physics. This is what defined him.
I know i just had this idea and I thought either im nuts or its a good idea. < - > I think you mentioned this idea to me a few years ago, and yes, I do want one!
I'm glad you chose this one. < - > And yet, the one that seemed the most fun.
I found ``Zionist Regime`` and other descriptions instead. < - > If it says Zionist regime it should say so in the quote.

So so so so pretty! < - > Have I mentioned how gorgeous you are?
I got a call today from my friend and he asked me , why do I hate BJP.  My Answer was this and it is for all of you.  Any party who is in power I will be a critic and not a supporter. I do not and will not belong to any party. Only loosers bow to people in Power. < - > @BlogDrive Absolutely agree That's what I also think  No one should blindly follow any of the political parties But the problem now is that if u don't like BJP or any of there work , u r Antinational Pakistani anti hindu.......... Many people have gone blind during this BJP Rule
Vanessa probably had to get really stoned to marry Donny Jr! Look at his hair! Why TF is Ivanka also in white??? The kid on the right looks like he's just smelled his own fart!  Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the Cheeto... https://t.co/VyJdB5Dvfe < - > @wokeluisa Gotta agree and they all look at least sedated, except the generally unhappy looking Ivanka - maybe she had to deal with the photographer?

I'd recommend that you take this to Peer Review before renominating for FAC (and advertise the peer review at all of the wikiprojects). < - > Another peer review might be a good idea.
I guess you don't approve of a source that is geared to young adults like those who attend Universities? < - > You guessed right.
it's so cozy < - > yeah, i like that it manages to be clearly very nice and ritzy while still being cozy and home-like.
Seventeen are one of the best groups in kpop ever and they deserve to be on every chart hitting #1 and being successful kings < - > @KGROUPCONFESS on behalf of the whole kpop fandom i wanna say we agree
So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf, the Doctor, Donna, and maybe the green people? < - > The Doctor Who Confidential said that the only four left were The Master, The Doctor, Donna and Wilf.
I said it once and I will say it again...To bring excitement and energy to @UGABasketball    the most ideal choice is @TomCrean < - > @DickieV @UGABasketball @TomCrean I agree... no brainer!  Great meeting and talking with you yesterday at ODA!!
Relationship based social work - second edition has my personal endorsement and  begs to be read., out now Jessica Kingsley publishing < - > @DCSEssex My current commute read Dave and I entirely agree https://t.co/XAC4fS8pUl
One reason so many folks want to put Xi in context of "a new Mao" or "a new emperor," is that it is easier to understand things in terms of (reasonably) familiar past paradigms than to face the possibility that what is happening is something new which we do not yet understand. < - > @JeremiahJenne @MariaRepnikova Agree. It also becomes a barrier to analysing not just what is happening under Xi, but also why these new trajectories are emerging. Too much denunciation, to point where it prevents attempts to form understandings of where China is going, how will change.
Hugs for all of you. < - > My sympathies and love are with you both.
I adore moving. < - > i absolutly love being in a new place.
So that study that is going around that there is "little" change between preprint and final published manuscripts. Lots of folks saying it's proof publishers don't add value. My Qs: What's the comparison? How much change would = value? Is it just volume of change not quality? < - > @lisalibrarian I agree that this kind of value cannot really be measured. Sometimes just a comma makes a world's difference in meaning. Instead, what we should do is look at publisher behavior to estimate the value they themselves put on their work.
I'm pretty sure we're at least close to the same page - it's partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter's father opt out. < - > Comes right down to it, I have to agree with you - the opt-out can only work if it doesn't leave the mothers high and dry.
Love to you all. < - > Hugs to both of you.
he's hot < - > oh he's cute
Yeah, especially the whole thing's starting to die down a bit. < - > I agree that it's not big enough for its own section yet.
To whoever gets my liver when I die, I am totally ok if you have a couple of drinks. Seriously people need to get off their high horses. < - > @deemadigan Usually l agree with you, but on this one l don't. My son is slowly killing himself with alcohol. Alcoholism is death by 1000 cuts. It kills more people than any other drug.
Union Square was a mob scene. < - > We watched it on TV last night, it was so amazing!
Don't know. Feels like it's this week or bust. https://t.co/0Z5wP3D1Ny < - > @JMcDonald_SAEN Fair enough. I agree there.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I'm not sure how ''prominent'' it should be, but the lead should certainly reflect the new data.
Look, I hate this buffoon but divorce is a very painful thing. I kind of don't believe in kicking people when they're down, and this guy is down. https://t.co/MeKpe66Dts < - > @JenAshleyWright I would usually agree. Feel for his kids. But kick this jerk with steel toed boots. If not for America, kick him on behalf of all the endangered animals he has murdered. Seriously. Kick him HARD
I love Rodrigo (: < - > I love Rodrigo!
i love it. < - > It's really pretty!!!!!!
The Doctor and Wilf's interactions made up for some of the confusion, as did seeing the Master in women's clothing < - > I agree, the Doctor and Wilf scenes helped a lot.
NFL is pretty chill when it comes to violence against women and brain damage but i guess free speech is where they draw the line < - > @Kappa_Kappa While I disagree that this is a free speech issue, I agree that this has garnered waaay more attention than violence against women and all other things that are more pressing and more damaging to this country than ppl kneeling during the anthem.

the answer is Yes, 10k menhom minimum 3k rent minimum masalan fadel 7k for 3 kids!! el amr el waqe3 is that the economical state of the country is shit and everything is expensive, instead of whining, be smart and know your limits. https://t.co/Q8GUc8STln < - > @zalyazy Minimum 3k rent? Because if they are poor they will be renting in tagamo3? Lol some people only became categorized as poor during the last 5 years only, some of them had the kids already. You see I don't disagree with u that 20k or above is a good number but you should also know

For all the #Caps fans who kept watching. Kept hoping. Kept believing. Kept saying that "this team was different" and getting made fun of for it. This is yours. < - > @granthpaulsen We don't always agree on everything, but that goes to you, too. You weren't one of those media guys who wavered every five minutes. Congrats to you, too!
I have nothing but contempt for women who do this. It makes it that much harder for an actual victim.  https://t.co/V6SDStOK5o < - > @bethanyshondark It makes life pretty rotten for the wrongly accused as well, don't you agree? I can only imagine the amount of hate directed at the poor man who did nothing wrong. I agree with your point about 'real victims', but the man is the victim here.
I liked this episode, except I thought there was too much Pastor Tim.  The odds of Vegas winning the Stanley Cup were shorter than Pastor Tim surviving @TheAmericansFX, but do miracles happen? Yes! https://t.co/UMcgqwgLQo < - > @BenMank77 @TheAmericansFX yes, too much Tim.  But don't you agree that very few series have maintained their power and watchability like The Americans during their entire run?  It's been, tritely but truly, an oasis in the desert of tv programs. Exquisite acting, writing, direction.
Saying "We own these footballers and they have no rights" would've been more direct. And also something we already know you think. https://t.co/rSoQ4ufH6x < - > @JimSterling That's how employment works. While I'm on the clock, I can't sit or play around with my phone. You agree to follow certain rules for money.
Republicans are going to pay a very big price for not standing up to this President's war against our men &amp; women of the FBI. < - > @WalshFreedom Joe I agree with most of your posts but not this one.  I don't see him attacking the FBI but the corrupt people in it.  A profession as noble and important as the FBI should welcome all scruinty and and transparently display it's professionalism. Including cutting corruption.
I disagree that it's bullshit. I think the majority of "Free Speech Warriors" you get exposed to online are akin to the "SJWs" on the other side of that coin, because they make the most noise. https://t.co/3ptSxQEjWl < - > @PapaBirdJake I agree with you, Jake. I believe in Free Speech and I don't want censorship for anyone. There are Left Wing and Right Wing folks that want to restrict one form of speech or another, but true Free Speech advocates respect the right of even their critics to speak.
This article may be a backhanded compliment but I'll take it ;-) https://t.co/Zee26EWv8g < - > @MeghanMcCain I don't always agree with you but I defend your right to your thoughts &amp; opinions.
Trump should stop his divisive rhetoric about the Anthem... All it does is stir the pot... < - > @PapaKelch I agree tweets don't help but that being said NFL should have taken action on its own
Or maybe do a class for men on how not to attack women? It shouldn't be the responsibility of women to solve the issue of violence against women. https://t.co/Vcxs47dXz2 < - > @1fivefive I think Johns offer is admirable  but agree the bigger issue is WHY are men behaving like this.i don't feel safe as a woman anymore.
https://t.co/mxvFvVcz1V < - > @Maxtyler98 This was a good meme even though I don't really agree with unions. That's how good this meme is.
A pope who  denies the existence of hell  denies the immortality of the soul  denies the universal, binding authority of God's commandments  denies Our Lord's teaching on marriage and divorce  denies that homosexuality is a disorder with an inclination to sin https://t.co/mYzTShHOCF < - > @ProtecttheFaith Our silent Cardinals don't apparently agree.  By their silence they support PF, ++s Maradiaga, Sorondo, Marx, Kasper ...  Unfortunately the laity also do by their donations. When will this schism be formally recognised?
The sub feed was the last place that was untouched by YouTube's "optimization". Now YT can make ur channel completely invisible even to ur own subscribers. Stop wasting our time @TeamYouTube - just erase the sub button already and show us what you want us to watch. https://t.co/FKcE3XUplc < - > @h3h3productions @Lauren_Southern @TeamYouTube Careful what you wish for.  It's possible that because of sarcastic responses like this, that they are able to pursue their goals. Especially when it gets backed up with likes and retweets - this shows that people agree.  Sarcasm doesn't translate well when you can't hear it.
THIS is f*cking dangerous rhetoric.  Yes - a company can enforce rules related to speech.  But a country can not expel people for speech.  This runs completely contrary to the spirit of the 1st Amendment and is authoritarian to the f*cking core. https://t.co/CnQbrkgAbl < - > @jkempcpa Agree 100%. Now watch some too-woke people say "you're letting Trump get away with X by calling this out, don't get distracted from his bigger issues". Wrong. This kind of crap from Trump needs to be called out as the fascist, authoritarian BS it is.
Intersex conditions are genetic disorders. They have nothing to do with transgenderism and intersex people hate that they are being used this way. < - > @MarkinBerkeley @MarkDSwartz I partially agree. Some, Transgender people have a biological intersex condition involving the brain sex. What we don't know; is the percentage of those who identify as transgender but in actuality were born with an intersex condition involving their biological brain sex.
https://t.co/xS5Q9ibYrV < - > @JOEL9ONE I agree with you 100% Chris Long. I think this was a cowardly move by the owners. Their explanation for the rule does not make sense. First of all, they can't define the term disrespecting the flag or anthem without being biased. Bowing and/or kneeling is a sign of respect.
Thoughts from the Weight Room  https://t.co/CxrZFDkK40 < - > @SeanSkahan I agree with the bands on pull-ups. Becomes too easy when you use them.  We've switched to inverted rows for those that can't do many pull-ups, start with those and then slowly transition to pull-ups as strength is gained.  Slow eccentrics work really well like you said too.
Taking a break from talking about brands to what brands should have at their core: soul https://t.co/8LqhZ5A5SB cc @tobyshorin (maybe interesting, possibly not) < - > @maxniederhofer Can't say I agree with this idea of a true self. Self knowledge and learning your own values are important, but in what way are "the protective layers, the self-destructive patterns, the conditioning and reflexive reactions" not also the "authentic" you?
I have been very thankful for the wisdom of our Citizen Journalists. It's so refreshing. Turning off the noise of propaganda and creating a community of #Truth. #Rebirth #Q #SethRich #FBICorruption #StolenPrimary #Coup https://t.co/CNhszC1kcu < - > @TifaLockhart78 I agree and have to add that very unfortunately, many people stop at the truth /lies in politics and don't take it any farther (geo engineering, 5G, other human and planet killing things) than that. While we (me too!) are looking here, they're over THERE.
I'm a #conservative. I disagree with @TomiLahren. Vehemently, in fact. But physically assaulting someone because they disagree with you politically shows a total lack of class and dignity. #realtalk https://t.co/wXlbNcCPQA < - > @bobb4jesus @TomiLahren I totally agree. Except I don't consider some water on her arm as assault.  If she's going to use hateful rhetoric all the time (with shades of racism) she needs to understand that eventually someone is push back in a really awful way that we really don't want.
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends < - > @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends have you slept with her, she's your type.  But I agree she is a lying brat who creates dissension and fear and is self serving and a brat, but nobody should be subject to physical assault for their beliefs.  to bad you don't get it ( grabbing women as you do)
A message to my solo ranked teammates https://t.co/aqVjhwEFhp < - > @squirtdynamo @Vicvillon While I don't 100% agree here, I will say seeing an aerospray use their special whilst on the tower in TC is kinda funny to see
Totally +1 https://t.co/LpjqDUmJKs < - > @Dravidict Don't quite agree with that. Being a social justice warrior is not mandatory just because he is popular. In case of Virat, that's not his field of action. Good if he stands up against the atrocities, not bad if he doesn't.
Seems to me that if you make false accusations like this, there should be some penalty for it. https://t.co/5S8UnsICwI < - > @terryschappert I agree especially if you don't maliciously then you should brought to book.
Please don't. https://t.co/LkrDyjf68s < - > @MKBHD I agree with you  Please don't do it @TeamYouTube
All the people who were so angry about Google firing James Damore are now very angry that the NFL is formally punishing the expression of controversial political views in the workplace, right? https://t.co/uL5hQXGh1G < - > @ggreenwald @ggreenwald who are you dealing with on the right? Don't strawman us. Yes, both are ridiculous cases. We agree. Don't be so smugly aggressive!
'Miami football: Quarterback Malik Rosier thrives under pressure' via @fansided https://t.co/9tXWi0M1ko < - > @CanesWarningFS @FanSided and I agree with this totally. That said though, he has to produce and be consistent every week. Can't have one good week, and then the next week, he has a terrible performance.
Ab-so-lutely. I wasn't kidding when I said that I can predict all of this! My book #GaslightingAmerica reveals all of Trump's tricks! https://t.co/3x3g9LMXqt < - > @amandacarpenter It's funny. I agree with you on Trump, but isn't there any possible way you can ALSO see that FBI/DOJ has been politicized and has acted improperly at best and illegally at worst? Or do you suffer from so much TDS that you can't see their behavior is dangerous, too?
I think the whole paragraph about them should go, possibly replaced by something very simple along the lines of, ''After Vatican II, Mass was permitted to be conducted in vernacular languages; the original Latin Mass can also still be performed.'' Details of differences between the two should probably go in the article about the Mass, since this is just a summary. < - > I disagree, because it's more than just a difference in language; this change was very destructive to the Church the way it was rolled out...Statues and stained glass windows were smashed...people were threatened with excommuniction for kneeling during the consecration as reently as 2 years ago and there was the lie that the Latin Mass was ''outlawed'' causing several breakaway groups in the Church.
16-year-old Abigail had some feels about this: Shame On The Jewish Schools That Skipped The Walkout https://t.co/750M8FcGvJ via @jdforward < - > @bungarsargon @jdforward I have some choice words for 16 year old Abigail,but I'll suffice to say I STRONGLY disagree with her.
I was thinking myself that it wasn't really a lead matter, and since that sentence is duplicated virtually word for word at its proper place in the article, it should go. < - > Removing it will leave a hole in logic and prevent the reader from knowing a key detail about what the church thinks about itself.
No, a frame can have one or more coordinate system(s). < - > Hence, any Cartesian coordinate selection can be converted to any curvilinear set.
Sen. Rand Paul slams CIA Director pick Gina Haspel: "It almost seemed to be a little bit of glee in her voice that she actually enjoyed the torture, and I think that's not who we need to lead.." https://t.co/fGMe1gdJXp < - > @joshdcaplan I rarely disagree with Rand, but this is one such case.  When the deep state cabal starts getting rounded up and sent to gitmo, I will be 100% in support of torture.  These criminals need to turn on each other in order to fully drain the swamp.
This piece of shit singlehandedly made overwatch not fun https://t.co/IQcq9mizJo < - > @Necromancer_sho I DISAGREE
Add a NPOV dispute tag in the TM article. < - > I don't see the need for more discussion over it, another Rfc, or a re-application of the NPOV tag, but let's take it as it comes.
Changing it will make it POV anti-Catholic and factually lacking. < - > I'm sorry, Nancy, I don't understand how this version is anti-Catholic.
It is not necessarily true that profit is reinvested in production. It is frequently used for consumption (often quite conspicuously so!) or lent to non-production entities (e.g. buying government bonds, lending for consumption loans, mortgages, student debt, etc.). < - > I am not arguing that all profits are reinvested into production, all I am saying is that profits in general have to be reinvested into production for the system to function. Yes, some profits are consumed by owners of capital, but overall, there has to be a reinvestment of profits into the economy for the system to reproduce itself.
While I don't at all agree with the seal hunt, I give huge props to this:Senator fires back at U.S. < - > I used to be against it, until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute, and these are the ones I don't like seeing killed (seals, deers, rabbits, kangaroos) that sometimes it is necessary.
'That's Not Helpful': Democrats Criticize @HillaryClinton for Her Remarks About @realDonaldTrump Voters https://t.co/SmZeifjTth < - > @FoxNews @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump I disagree.  It shows everyone with a mind that this is who she really is.  Those who deny who she really is now should open their eye and ears.
I mean, that's sort of a relief from seeing all the bad stuff that usually goes on. < - > It was so lame, I felt so ashamed and I wasn't even the idiot saying it!
Yeah that does seem kinda hypocritical...but is that the argument that's being made (I agree that FOX is way more reliable than MMFA and the likes) < - > However, while the worst MSNBC have done is lean to the left, FOX has a history of failing to do basic fact checking: before Sanford, they called Specter, Foley, and even McCain Democrats on one occasion or another.
Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD. < - > I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church.
i have no words https://t.co/58jibPSQAv < - > @_annabellll But are you speechless because you agree or disagree?
My take: "developer" captures best what we do when developing software, other terms evoke unhelpful analogies: engineer (apply science/math, how often do we do this?), architect ("drawing a house on paper"), coder (coding is not the most important part of sw dev) < - > @try_except_ I disagree. I don't see cooks prancing around telling everyone how they also invent recipes, cut food, and fry things. Developing can be applied to pretty much any job where one makes things.
If unomi takes out the quote, I'll support that. < - > I think the quote should remain because it is absolutely relevant to the evolution of the term.
As for the possible ambiguities, there is nothing ambiguous about not accepting a religion because you don't accept everything they espouse hook, line and sinker. < - > And many Christians self-identify as Christian with the concomitant understanding that Christianity is the ''one true faith'' and the only path to salvation. Should we add that as a definition of Christianity?
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Nope, common descent does not produce biodiversity.
When we think of Jesus forgiving our sins why do we think of "punishment by other means"? That's not how we use the word in normal life. We usually mean "bearing away, looking past" the transgression. < - > @geoffholsclaw I disagree. In normal life we mean, "I'll bear the debt you owe and not require payment." When we "look past" as you put it, we're actually bearing some suffering in their place and remaining open to the relationship.
This a lie. Bay Area fans the biggest fair weather fans of them all. https://t.co/az3vU534VS < - > @AlexandriaRae_ I completely disagree with your statement, ether way 49er fans are more loyal then raider fans
Besides your well-founded objections, the proposed intro is unclear, both as to terminology and as to what is meant by the terms it defines. < - > The proposed intro is quite clear and perfectly correct.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I'm not sure how ''prominent'' it should be, but the lead should certainly reflect the new data.
So nothing wrong with technical here. < - > I never said it is wrong.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR We teach kids to think for themselves then somebody decides to crucify them for doing so.  Kids are more informed on as the  issues facing this country than any other generation in history, just because you don't agree with their way of thinking. Does not mean they are wrong.
Like I said, the term ''British Isles'' is not an official term, but ''Solar System'' and Carribbean are recognised as official terms by most heads of governments. It's a simple change and is a lot more logical. < - > No Solar System is not an official term.
Yep, it's the only thing standing between him and global domination. https://t.co/AfUgEieeSs < - > @GCTigerTracker I'll respectfully disagree because of his rescue skills from anywhere. It's his 18th place stat for strokes gained putting. THAT'S THE ISSUE. Once he gets that into the top 5, it's all over for everyone else
So to have criticism in one but not the other is just ludicrous. < - > There is a huge difference between the criticism aimed at Obama and the criticism aimed at Bush.
Be sure and click on the link of the principal's name. It will take you to the #idiot's page. Tell him we have the #1A VIDEO: School Principal Removes Student Holding Pro-Gun Sign..."Threatened to be Put in Police Car" https://t.co/yF4PWqFzm3 via @100percFEDUP < - > @fbc1955 @100PercFEDUP This is the tough guy @lonnie_seifert4 that violated a students freedom of speech #1A rights @NP_Trojans HS bc he had alternative viewpoint on guns. #FireLonnieSeifert now.

Hence these people know it better than you. < - > And I know the Bible way better than them.
current.com is Current TV, so I don't know how you can support that statement. < - > Uhm, you don't know how I can support that, really? Did you notice community.current.com? Did you notice ''keithponder added this'' or Source: Youtube? - I don't know what it is about this article and the suspension of rational thought but it is starting to freak me out.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR Shame on you as a parent for telling me to deny my child the right to speak his mind. It's his 1st amendment right. Shame on you for placing your values above ours. You don't have to agree, just get out of the way.  #NeverAgain #NationalWalkOutDay #NationalSchoolWalkout
The sentance implies that the net energy output of the sun is zero (''the amount of energy absorbed by the sun is equal to the amount released'') which is of course a ridiculous statement. < - > Roland Deschain: I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero.
I hate Donald Trump too!@IHATEDONALDTR11 < - > @JuliaWare18 Donald Trump is a failure and he must be stopped. Part of doing that is learning to talk to those we disagree with. Check out this documentary about millions of Americans like you struggling to maintain hope: https://t.co/7mMNsjcudJ ^EM
I think the whole paragraph about them should go, possibly replaced by something very simple along the lines of, ''After Vatican II, Mass was permitted to be conducted in vernacular languages; the original Latin Mass can also still be performed.''

I propose that paragraph 3 of the lead be edited to reflect the following changes: ''The risk of an asymptomatic person with a repeatedly reactive serum sample (for HIV) developing AIDS or an AIDS-related condition is not known. < - > I surmise that you meant paragraph 4 of the lead, not paragraph 3.
Bam doesn't deserve this. What happened between her and Cee C?   #BBNaija < - > @Ikech_Balogun Nothing...ppl must diagree when working together due to different opinions and ideas,they in a good place pls....don't we all disagree with our friends sometimes,not that deep
#FreeCrowder https://t.co/Aj2KBLR97b < - > @CRTV @dbongino @verified Stop harrassing Conservatives!! I am in contact with my Congressman about regulating companies that discriminate against Americans you disagree with. Your forum should be a place without repressive attacks on us.
Placing it in the lead gives it undue prominence in relevance to the church. < - > Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.
I didn't know we edit-war our way into this. < - > No one is edit warring.
We continue to see attempts by secularists, LGBTQ, etc to undermine parental rights over children, so they can indoctrinate kids in their worldview based on the religion of naturalism. Sadly, gender issue has become a major tool in this indoctrination   https://t.co/5eKbDj4CqY < - > @aigkenham The Bully LHBTQA+? Movent isn't"content" in carrying on with their Alt Chosen genders,but they want to Forcefully Impose It upon those who,because they hold Deep Moral Principles, don't Agree with such lifestyles that Divert  from Normalcy.
Doxxing pedophiles is A ok with me < - > @AltPuppy I don't agree with either. I don't like niggas who dox, and I very much dislike pedofiles.
I lived in Africa for many years and I can confirm that in Africa, the term ''black people'' is regarded as highly offensive. Color coding is western culture. < - > I am an African, born in Africa, and I have never known an African who regards it as ''highly offensive'' to be called ''black''. In my language we call black Africans jo acol without any pejorative connotations. Jo acol means black people.
my school in Alabama walked out. we stood up for ourselves...in the process our teachers mocked us, threatened us, and tried to silence us. one teacher started ARGUING with me.   BUT WE MUST NOT BACK DOWN  #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @ughh_erin Good teachers will support your right to protest even if they disagree with your politics. You're a stronger person than every one of them that mocked you.
People would have been able to see the real Terri, not the one fabricated by the mass media and government powers that be. < - > She had massive brain damage and was unable to speak, walk, recognise people, or enjoy a reasonable standard of living. The real Terri? She was long since gone.
My gut feeling today? Irving is gone gone and Dez stays one more season at full boat salary. No change to terms. < - > @KeithDeuces Only thing I can think of is they have little trust in Irving now and will have zero trust once he gets paid. Would rather get a 2 than nothing. I don't agree but that's the only thing I can think of
J.K. Simmons - J. Jonah Jameson Christopher Reeve - Superman Robert Downey Jr. - Iron Man Ryan Reynolds - Deadpool Alan Cumming - Nightcrawler https://t.co/yPxHxWX5lT < - > @DT2ComicsChat The more I think about this the more I disagree. Ledger did a fantastic performance and is a very good interpretation of the Joker but it's not a good comic portrayal. He created his own version and in a lot of ways it's a long way from any version that's ever been in the comics
If serious concerns are being expressed around suggestion #5, in particular, if constraints on the best summaries are being proposed, then I propose we even do a complete Rfc on the subject because, if we have to create a consensus around the best summaries within suggestion #5, we must do it right. < - > That sounds painful. An rfc is a cumbersome way to edit an article; particularly if you want to wait weeks for input by uninvolved editors (who almost by definition have little interest in the topic).
Your abusive response that does not attempt anything, but simply inventories various nasty adjectives, indicates that there is no purpose in trying to talk to you. < - > There was nothing abusive in my response, unless you consider that anyone who disagrees with you, and backs up their disagreement with detailed explanations and extensive references, is ''abusive''.
(See, I'm really not a name-caller by nature!) The solution: create a new article. < - > I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship.
Any citizen, foreign or otherwise, that's staying in an area that has publicly elected hostile militants into their government for the sole purpose of launching attacks on a neighboring country should've thought about that before they moved to the god-damned area. < - > the fact that they are lebanese-australians who were over visiting relatives who don't really get to decide who their neighbours are in an area with no real variety in housing options probably can explain a few things :)
The State can lie It lied over Iraq WMD so it can lie over nerve agents attack Maybe so, Jeremy Corbyn but remember, what will we believe if, one day, you are a PM, there is a crisis, and you point the finger here or there? < - > @jacquep Also I disagree that the State"lied" reWMD. It certainly made the evidence fit their agenda but deliberately lied?Not if u've read the Blix report of 2002which listed whatWAS found (&amp;subsequently disappeared).Unfortunately tho,this has led 2the suspicion of experts we have today
So many kids are getting suspended from school for participating in the #NationalWalkoutDay yesterday.  This is outrageous. The walkout was part of their education, not a break from it. < - > @realMatMolina I disagree.  Have to learn rules are rules , there ARE consequences for breaking the rules . Sometimes it is right and good to accept those consequences to make your point
Im sure many will be surprised. If youre not youre rightwing according to these nay sayers https://t.co/N55ITg1Tpd < - > @HenriLeRiche I disagree with the whole "Apartheid was better" trope. Maybe from a safety &amp; security POV but think about it - 5m whites took stewardship of 30m+ blacks. That is not only insulting to them but also illogical and unsustainable. Whites became de facto #gibsmedat slaves
I am not saying we should use only one, but the contrary, state both category and coefficient like in the ''Sweden'' article. Of course, this should be done for all of those countries, but we have to start somewhere. < - > Excuse us, but you referred to the purported ''Gini category'' as a ''fact''. On exactly what basis do you claim this so-called ''category'' to be a ''fact''?
Clicking on the ISBN rarely works right for me. < - > Clicking on the ISBN works right for more people than do GBooks links.
Most politicians are either ignorant or gullible on this. Very few understand or know the issue, as I found when I gave evidence to Home Affairs Cttee a few years ago https://t.co/4pxQX8WpEk < - > @ClarkeMicah I don't disagree on that. Last one (for now!), if politicians were less ignorant/gullible on this issue, would you have more faith that certain regulations could reduce harm; and if not, why not?
as for the topic discussed, i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation ''wipe israel off the map'' is a misquote. < - > The initial quote by the Iranian translator was ''wiped off the map'' and that is what resulted in the notable outcry from world leaders.
You can use coordinate systems and coordinate transformations to translate from one reference frame to another, but they are not the same thing. < - > Once again, frames are equivalence classes of mutually stationary coordinate systems.
No, if you look towards the bottom of the page (in the succession navigation box), where predecessors and successors for any awards, offices, etc one has held or received, you will clearly see that Carol Moseley Braun is his ''predecessor'' and Alexi Gianoulias as his ''successor''. < - > That portion is actually correct, as Carol Moseley Braun was the Democratic nominee for that senate seat in 1998 and lost to Peter Fitzgerald.
I'm not one of the main editors even though I argue here a lot; my content contributions have been very very narrowly focused although I've done a lot of copyediting. < - > Contributing here is surely part of the Wikipedia editing process?
Allusions don't make something significant. < - > I agree with Lucas - those references may not be significant to YOU Mintrick, but they may well be significant to many readers.
But the literature reflects a variety of views on the conceptualisation of atheism. < - > ''This article cannot resolve that variety, only reflect it.'' Yes, ofcourse - but it should reflect it in a manner that emphasizes the consensus position, same as with our other articles, we should not give WP:UNDUE weight to fringe positions, and we should not present them as if they held more currency than the sources available to us indicate.
The fact that a book was published 30 years ago is irrelevant. < - > No, date of publication is not irrelevant.
''44th, and current, President'' might be correct, but your phrasing is as incorrect as ''a tall, and thin man''.-- < - > Your orange stems from the use of a single comma as substitute for the word and between two adjectives, as in changing ''he is a tall and thin man'' to ''he is a tall, thin man''.
It is much longer and omits the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse.Wassupwestcoast, there are some serious flaws in your new rewrite, references numbers 225 and 226 do not support the sentence they reference and number 226 is not a news article, it is an opinion piece which are not OK refs in Wikipedia. < - > I wouldn't emphasize too much the '' the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse'' because there are still new cases coming forward.
The title was the only problem. < - > The problem was and is that this list does not serve as an explanation of the philosophical concept of a pseudoscience, but as a coatrack for fringe-bashing.
Also the term ''modern'' is entirely POV too in the ''modern'' day the Church has 1,130,000,000 followers, modern people, who by choice of their faith do not agree with killing unborn babies either. < - > The ''Modern challenges faced by the church'' phrasing is good.
Blustering Boris Johnson is unable to answer the questions put to him. #r4today < - > @MaggieLavan I disagree. He was unable to get a word in edge ways - he was interrupted so much!!
I will remove further abuse as allowed by the talk guideline. < - > This is NOT abuse, but rather discussion regarding why or why not an edit should or should not be included.
In any event both you and I know that the actual policy enacted throughout this period was not relocation - nor was it actually deportation (even if we use such a word for conveinience sake - use of such is actually entirely incorrect). < - > The word ''deportations'' has been used since 1915 in relation to the Armenian genocide; one of the best known document's produced to illustrate the genocide's effects is the map titled ''The Routes of Deportations'' first published back in 1920.
it's like the universal law, Saturday is for slacking off < - > saturday=lecture day.
And at the risk of saying something that really ought to go without saying, Scjessey was absolutely correct to revert Unomi's deletion of the quote. There was no consensus for simply deleting it from the page. < - > I don't see how it's possible to establish a consensus, if Scjessey really thinks that Harris is representing a mainstream view.
Stop blaming students. Better idea? parents &amp;culture stop telling kids that the best way to deal w/a bully is violence. This advice is not only unpractical, but doesn't do anything to build future citizens that obviously can't resolve problems by "punching the guy in the nose!" < - > @JudLounsbury Based on my childhood experience not fighting back against a bully, I have to disagree strongly. The bullies take it as weakness and keep it up. Kids need to stand up for themselves. How that "fighting" happens matters but I eventually did it via wrestling, which worked.
I recommend reading through F.R. < - > Scott was entitled to his opinion, which probably has its merits.
(I don't see a problem with the term. < - > Yes, either of those would be better than 'pre-Indo-European'.
I believe it is entirely consistent with wikipedia practice and policy. < - > This proposal is incorrect on policy.
Here, it is textbook well-poisoning. < - > I disagree but have removed it.
Interesting article. Anyone have thoughts here? Pls no wars.  https://t.co/yP7aAk3TFa < - > @TheEvilDM That is his opinion &amp; he is welcome to it but I disagree, vehemently. Lots of people CANT play (no groups, poor internet, wonky schedules, ect) so should we call them fake gamers because they experience the game THROUGH someone else?  Nay, say I. They contribute in their own way.
My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > Single version Dual version We should stay with the single CoA, as Wales & Northern Ireland are within the United Kingdom aswell.
BasedFather has spoken. #FreeCrowder https://t.co/m316GJiuLc < - > @Courtneyscoffs Laughter is the most effective weapon against authoritarians, dictators and religious fanatics . Which is why I like @scrowder even though I don't agree with everything he says.  It's still funny.
As for your insinuation that a copyright violation occurred, I cannot see how referencing the work of others is a copyright. < - > The latter states, ''If the external work is under standard copyright, then duplicating its text with little, or no, alteration into a Wikipedia article is usually a copyright violation, unless duplication is limited and clearly indicated in the article by quotation marks, or some other acceptable method (such as block quotations)''.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
he pushes the food into my mouth, he lifts me from the carpet, he loves me always, he remembers for me, he saves me. < - > You don't really need someone to save you.
Catholics are challenging the Pope about the sex abuse denial and not Anglicans or Protestants. < - > There are hundreds of disaffected catholic and crypto-catholic groups with websites, ranging from pro-abortionists to groups that think the Pope is Protestant!
I'm tired of hearing that the only reason a person could be pro-Second Amendment is because they're "beholden to the NRA."   Not-so-breaking-news: Many are constitutionalists. Many believe in a natural right to self-defense. Not everyone who disagrees with you is nefarious. < - > @CorieWhalen Labeling viewpoints as nefarious or evil makes it easier to dismiss any valid points w/o any valid points of their own and rallies people to their side via emotional appeal.  "You only disagree with me because &lt;evil&gt;!"  No good defense or rebuttal to that in the court of emotion.
The term waterboarding and the controversy around it revolve around its recent use by the united States government. < - > Yes the term is recent but as you point out the practice itself is old.
Valet testifies #TexMcIver jumped out of the SUV and shouted "gunshot to the back" when he arrived at #EmoryHospital. < - > @MPetchenikWSB people saying video show hurrying I disagree
This article can not be FA quality without a better discussion of the scandal. < - > The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church.
Thanks for doing that yesterday @IvankaTrump - where are you today? 3,100 schools across the country are standing up &amp; demanding sensible action on gun control. Do you stand with them? https://t.co/YcAPyTrZ92 < - > @SRuhle @IvankaTrump Stephanie, you should know that Ivanka has said that she publicly doesn't disagree with her father or the stance of the White House. She doesn't stand for anything unless it gets her a good photo op to help her increase her brand awareness, she's useless.

I can imagine this is your typical response from @SpursOfficial regarding ticket prices. Not remotely surprised by the uncaring attitude they have, not just to the fans but pensioners like my Dad. https://t.co/Ha5PSEs0zz < - > @hellothere_64 @clockendsniper @SpursOfficial We might disagree on alot of stuff, but I am sure we all agree that we dont want more leg room or comfy seats especially if we get charged more for it, we want our football back, tv and prem have totally ruined football,
Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding. At the same time we could do the much needed re-write of the US section now the CIA says it has waterboarded. < - > Look, this article doesn't need to tell the story of how Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was interrogated; he's got his own article, where that information can be found. All this article needs to do is note that ''the U.S.
The fact that most references specifically refer to rotating reference frames and that this article is about rotating reference frames?- ( < - > Looking at the six reference books on dynamics that I happen to have at my desk, your assertion is false.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics.
Most of them are dropped in the first case, and there are just a few prosecutions and not all off them are Armenian Genocide related. < - > Not all ''insulting Turkishness'' are because of acknowledging AG, but all those who did acknowledged AG have been persecuted by ''insulting Turkishness''.
Our longest war in Afghanistan is going to last a lot longer.  Trump has signed us up for an indefinite commitment.  Are the American people on board with this? https://t.co/0GdpAGK9uO < - > @AmbassadorRice @vali_nasr So this is all trumps fault?  I've fought there....it is every presidents fault since 9/11 and your admin had 8 years to do something different and didn't so now you throw stones?  I don't agree with staying but I also don't agree with the complicit redirecting blame.
You don't owe it to them or anything, but it is kind of shitty to have your lights on on Halloween when you aren't there / aren't planning to answer. < - > Now normally I would agree, to be courteous, but I was just visiting her house and the lady who yelled at me was SO rude about it.
Does that mean the Baptist wikipedia article must now centre on sexual abuse sscandals? < - > We are not discussing other articles, we are discussing this article.
Take notice of the kids who walked out today, in your community. These are the ones you won't want to hire in a few years. They fail at critical thinking, they don't care about the rights of others, they're group-think at its worst, they don't support personal responsibility. < - > @Connectionary Or they simply disagree with you on how to prevent being killed at school.   "Oh my God they're coming for my guns" is group-think at its worst. #NeverAgain #VetsForGunReform
This is not an issue of undue weight, but if anything of systeic bias (and is this case, of systemic bias in the sources). < - > It's undue weight because in historical perspective this is just one example.
Is violence ever the answer? https://t.co/cXmE0rh5UN < - > @AtheistRepublic Physically assaulting someone simply because you disagree with what they say/feel/think is a very dangerous slippery slope that ends with "might makes right." Freedom of Speech and Thought should be sacred to atheists.
I can't prove a the majority of an unbounded set, but I can state that for the set currently available to us the case seems made that the majority of them do support the usage in EBC: ''atheism is a positive denial''. If you wish to argue that EB does not reflect the consensus position then I would have to say that you are making an extraordinary claim that you need to make a case for. < - > You can't maintain that atheism is consensually ''a positive denial'' when Eller, for one, says it isn't a positive denial. Nor have you shown that ''positive denial'' bears the weight placed upon it. EB does not claim to represent a consensus position. It is explicitly Nielsen arguing for a particular position which he regards as a more adequate one.
You are trying to promote one particle POV on this subject, which is inappropriate, per Wikipedia policy. < - > Even if we assume you're correct, your argument is of the same form as arguing that electrostatics and magnetism are two sides of the same thing, namely, electromagnetism. Well, yeah. But we still have separate articles on electrostatics and magnetism.
I'm deleting without prejudice unless someone can give me a reason why not. < - > Removing the entire section wasn't a positive move toward change.

Scjessey - Your argument, that ''something written by an apologetic of some brand of theism'' is unreliable, is a specious one. Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism. Indeed, several Wikipedia articles would have to be reduced to a few historical lines using your logic. < - > @DoctorEric - The point I'm trying to make is that a theistic apologist isn't really qualified to offer opinions on atheism.
It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then ''This is an abortion.''. < - > (Reset indent)On the contrary, Talv, it would do a disservice to the quality of this article to open the floodgates to shock photos.
#ActuallyAutistic #AskingAutistics - Tell me how you feel about functioning labels. Do you approve or disapprove of them? Why?   I disagree because my #functioningfluxuates on a daily basis. < - > @NeuroRebel I disagree, because it's like saying "I'm normal" but adding lazy, or avaricious, or tall. We function on OUR levels. I have a system with Coworkers. They say how are you today? I reply with 'running about 80%' or 'crap night's sleep, down to about 40%' they know what to do then.
Our gathering lists of references is helpful, because it can demonstrate the relative prominence that different views should receive in the article. < - > This is still not proportional to the amount of sources.

I also like that lcps is letting students express themselves aldough they dont agree with them.
The picture on the left causes global outrage and even for EFF members to riot and trash stores.  Media tries to justify riots.   The picture on the right is just another normal slogan in South Africa.  Media silent. https://t.co/Dhjbj9u4a4 < - > @willempet I don't think you are welcome to make this comment, as much as I disagree with the message on the t-shirt, when we told u about the harm black people were caused by the monkey t-shirt, you and the Afriforum issued a statemeny basically dismissing the outrage as petty. Now u know
If you ask me, it's somewhat uncivil to equate Fox News and Wall Street Journal to Time Magazine and Salon.com. < - > Each of these publications is very different and I'm not equating them.
Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history! < - > @realDonaldTrump I love America more than Republican or Democrat or independent. Why are you not addressing the Russian attack on American democracy? It is clear that you are compromised. Prove me wrong. Aggressively attack Russian aggression like you attack people who disagree with you.

.@SHAQ: Put More Police Officers in Schools Instead of Banning Guns https://t.co/RgQwBARrRp https://t.co/2WaVvNBUPv < - > @FoxNews @SHAQ I thought people like him are to just "shut up and dribble." Or is it only when you don't agree with what they're saying? No wonder you all dropped "Fair and Balanced." Probably the only truthful thing you've ever done.
Unless we move back the Rfc tag (which would be pointless), the RFC is now closed. < - > Note that the archiving of the RfC was done by a 'bot, and has no official status.
There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article. < - > history, that's not minor.
If there a number of definitions that define it some other way then those should be there too. < - > I know you can find macroeconomic texts that mention this ''free market'' system, but guess what, we can't just look at those texts because they are not authoritative enough when it comes to the development of capitalism, the history of capitalism, nor the sociological and anthropological dimensions of capitalism. The definition needs to be broad - to match the breadth of the article, which covers the history, etymology and perspectives of capitalism. It isn't an economics textbook. The inclusion of ''free'' narrows the definition so much so as to be exclusionary of major authoritative perspectives (many of which are mentioned further down in the article such as Marx, Weber, Veblen and other major figures).
So we don't trust our own security services and should send a sample of the poison to Russia because we know we can trust theirs. Have I got this right, Corbyn disciples? < - > @mrjamesob I can either vote for man who seems like wants to do the right thing, and I might disagree with occasionally, or, the alternative options who "fuck up from bean to cup."
I love this, especially the first five lines. < - > My only real criticism comes in the form of the first few lines in each stanza.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). See WP:MEDRS for guidelines on the sort of sources we'd need for such claims. < - > ''Aspies'' are known for delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking. Two great examples of AS sufferers: Albert Einstein and Isaac Asimov.
What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture. < - > Strongly oppose.
Huttick, the Catholic Church believes Buddhism isn't a religion. < - > The 1st statement is incorrect. The 2nd Vatican Council calls Buddhism a religion ([10], section 2).
It's probably because of the basic stupidity of a lot of the people who feel the need to classify people on the simplistic basis of skin colour. It's very hard to describe such behaviour rationally and in an encyclopaedic way. < - > I don't agree that recognizing the differences between people is stupid.
Oppose inclusion, per Siafu. Also, if the material is retained, the titles ''Professor'' should be deleted, per WP:CREDENTIAL which says: ''Academic and professional titles (such as ''Doctor'' or ''Professor'') should not be used before the name in the initial sentence or in other uses of the person's name.''. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''.
We already have that. Are you going to keep asking uninvolved admins until you get a comment that you can in someway interpret in favor of your POV? < - > Where is this consensus from the previous uninvolved admin.
Perhaps we should just cite it to the 1928 source, in which case we should state the year in the text to alert the reader how long ago it was, or, if we feel the information is outdated, we should delete the sentence. < - > If I were reading the article for the first time, and I jumped down to a footnote that quoted a study from 1928, I would be immediately suspicious of the rest of the article. It's just bad sourcing.
Attacking loss is a loss. Defensive loss is a loss. Talk of "at least we attacked" is the same weak mentality you claim any manager that doesn't always play cavalier football has. No real winner is satisfied with anything less than winning. It is really that simple. < - > @biolakazeem I completely disagree with the notion that @ChelseaFC came to attack at Camp Nou! Capital NO. They were forced to attack because they conceded an early goal! They had nothing to lose! Its simple logic, and they chose to change the narratives of the 4 previous visit!
I am arguing that historians of capitalism would disagree with you: you can have capitalism without ''free'' markets, because ''free markets'' have never existed. There has always been government ''interference'' or regulation in markets, either to the benefit of business, labour, environment or whatever. Historical fact. < - > What do you mean free markets have never existed?
The Roman Catholic Church is the only one that officially calls itself the Catholic Church. < - > The Orthodox claims to be the Catholic Church: ''The Orthodox Church is the Catholic Church.'' [17]
Obama has also taken full responsibility for it which attaches the whole incident to his ''presidential hip''. < - > The response of his administration is typical and unremarkable.

How exactly do you ''measure positions'' without a coordinate system? A set of axes IS a coordinate system. Hence the name ''coordinate axes''. < - > No. Do you have a good reference saying that a frame of reference is exactly the same thing as a coordinate system? Because they're self evidently not the same.
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules. < - > ''It was agreed...'' = Using the passive tense to describe a decision without naming who or when is classic propaganda-speak.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). See WP:MEDRS for guidelines on the sort of sources we'd need for such claims. < - > I know the guidelines. And there are references, so what one might think is or is not out there is irrelevant.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > There are many mechanisms that do, but common descent in not one of them.
However, I do not see why 'highest third', 'lowest quarter' etc. < - > But again: on what basis are you choosing to divide into three parts...rather than into two...or rather than into four...or rather than into five...or rather than into...?
I imagine that what has happened is that in the POV push and pull that plagues articles like this, the information has been shredded by people, much like yourself, who place advocacy before policy and damage content. < - > I am not the one who put in any garbage about occupying regime.
Doing so does not, nor ever has, violate NPOV. < - > An endorsement of LDS theology like this is not acceptable under the WP:NPOV rule.
45 years ago today... https://t.co/jXhCFY9pK2 < - > @SenJohnMcCain I don't always agree with you, but my respect and admiration have never wavered.  Thank you for your service and the example you set each and every day.
I'm deleting without prejudice unless someone can give me a reason why not. < - > The statement - ''the regularity of his initiations had been disputed'' - is a pure fact, and get this: Crowley himself admitted that people disputed his Masonic regularity in his book ''Confessions.'' Note that in the sentence under discussion no attempt is made to discuss the thorny issue of whether an Irregular Masonic body is real Masonic body, or just something that purports to be Masonic.Hence for these reasons, I propose that the original wording should actually stand.
So @LouisFarrakhan is fine with Twitter, but @scrowder gets suspended for comedy routines. @jack, you're making an ass of yourself. #FreeCrowder < - > @benshapiro @LouisFarrakhan @scrowder @jack Easy for Twitter to censor those they disagree with when the definition of racism &amp; bigotry is so broad as to be ridiculous these days. #FreeCrowder .
New Rule: You only get to have an opinion on abortion if you have a vagina.   No vagina=No opinion   #righttochoose #yourbody < - > @ChrisWrightActs Man people are dumb as f@$*!  Woman's body=her choice to do what's best for her. More woman should have a say in policy that affect them. How can anyone disagree?! Hey...don't agree with abortion? Don't fucking have one and how about you adopt a few while you're on your soap box.
Apparently you are also prepared to defend your position that the direct paraphrasing the EB's definition with ''rejection of belief'' (which is also supported by Edwards, as well as by Smith and backed up by numerous dictionaries because of the use of ''disbelief'') must also leave the question of existence closed? < - > First of all, it is very rare that all sources will agree or use the same wording on a subject, no matter what the subject is. Second of all, you have to understand what ''rejection'' actually means, if you reject an offer - does that mean you are leaving the question of accepting the offer open ( leaving out here negotiation tactics )? You may later change your mind and accept it, but that holds true of any position. Same with disbelief, which merriam-webster defines as ''mental rejection of something as untrue''.
Stand up for Free Speech, stand up #ForBritain  https://t.co/ChbBolppRj < - > @AMDWaters anne you should look to your members in your facebook group they don't seem to believe in free speech. free speech means defending people who you don't agree with.
At the beginning of the war when Poland was invaded, the allies originally consisted of: Australia, British India, Canada, France, Poland, New Zealand, Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom. < - > No.
You also continue to be wrong and, as far as I can tell, are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position. < - > Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.
brushes are sooo much better at lint removal than rollers < - > @pr0xiii I strongly disagree with this statement.
Currently, I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA, that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote. < - > Descibe the creed in terms of its importance to the faith.
Two recently added images include a dead dog, which I find random and in somewhat bad taste, and an image of the pope, along with caption making POV assertions about his entrance to the 'afterlife'. < - > The Dog is clearly the best illustration of death put forth so far imho, the pope one is indeed POV.
It's been explained to you more than once. < - > You haven't addressed the argument above at all.
But when we are trying to present a picture of waterboarding as a general practice it does not make sense to have more than half of the article be examples from the last five years about the US military. < - > It's inevitable that most of this article is going to be about the recent use of waterboarding by the U.S.
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts, which is not criticism at all. < - > I never said that we should include negative facts for the sake of including them.
It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
What a great thread! Top 3 takeaways: 1. Make the offer signing process very serious. Contracts, NDA, penalty for not joining. via @anuj 2.

It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > No, it hasn't been agreed upon by all users yet.
Impunity may allow ODM to remove @Wetangulam as minority leader. But more importantly, ODM must first make up her mind whether she is in Jubilee's government or not. For if she is, then by law, she MUST forfeit PAC/PIC &amp; minority leadership in both houses to ANC, Wiper &amp; FORD K. < - > @KBonimtetezi @Wetangulam On this I disagree Mheshimiwa. The positions of Majority and Minority leadership are not to do with government or opposition (not even in the constitution) but about numbers in the House. As long as @TheODMparty remains, it deserves the position of Minority leader @BelAkinyii
''Just for the record'', the tag removal was accompanied in one instance by a major re-write of the article that removed all controversial material. That removal was instigated by PeR. In the second case, the reasons for placing the tag weren't presented, and the removal of the tag was accompanied by an explanation that was not contested. < - > Brews ohare's statements above are incorrect.
Wassap, I don't see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short. < - > There are still unresolved POV issues, issues with the writing and non-encyclopedic tone, reference and sourcing issues, and notable controversies glossed over and/or ignored.--
I thoroughly enjoyed it, less for the whinging and more for the astute observations of Hollywood culture. < - > I don't know...I don't feel like it's so astute to point out that the Oscars are kind of pompous and out of touch.

The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs. < - > However, I am not convinced that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
Actually, it is not describing the Creed (it is the Creed). < - > Descibe the creed in terms of its importance to the faith.

I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise). < - > ''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.
I am aware of the need for references, hence my suggestion the literature be culled. < - > I don't think speculating on someone would be useful, re: Einstien.
I liked Case as well. In my opinion think Cousins is a rare QB to hit the market and believe in him. High risk, high reward. https://t.co/EwjT8sDHvW < - > @SkolBros Interesting that you say that. Respectfully disagree. I think cousins' whole appeal is he's safe. Lower risk and lower reward. Consistent above average guy, not a top tier guy imo. Both are good reasons to sign him, so it's interesting to see the opposite sides of it
And threatening to put this on the blacklist just doesn't make sense. < - > I've blacklisted this based on the abuse, not the stuff above that gets people hot under the collar.
I think the sentence is good the way it is; it shows that the church, while believing itself to be the ''one true church'', also wants to work with others on common goals/for unity. < - > I would suggest no, and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section.
No one (save reality show stars) become famous/notable for their personal lives-its trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia. < - > I disagree that ''Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY.'' While no one, except mostly reality show stars, become famous/notable for their personal lives, I do not believe that it's trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia.
I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic (which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal, we lose several important wikilinks too. < - > It contains the same information, but is summarized so it does not have the details of the persecution of Catholics.
Oppose - This is clearly undue weight to the fringe journals, so it shouldn't be included in the article. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
Fake people have an image to maintain. Real people just don't care. < - > @neverknownfacts I disagree
Because nobody has a decent answer for the addition of some approval numbers, but the omission of others, I'm going to add the following sentence (which is properly sourced) As of August 2010, Rasmussen polls found that the total percent of approval was 44%, while the total percent of disapproval was 55%. < - > Disputed, so no consensus.
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead. < - > Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas.
Philosophical discussions will often lack (or include bias-selected) empirical data -- I could cite examples within this very article -- but that doesn't make them ''unreliable'' or unworthy of inclusion. < - > Prominent atheists like Harris, Russel etc are perfectly suitable for the subject matter of this article.
I hate the phrase "PC culture" &amp; the (insult?) snowflake, which at the end just means embracing individuality &amp; accepting that some people aren't exactly alike, but nonetheless still deserve the same treatment... BUT the bad rep we get by association is deserved. < - > Disagree with me or change my mind, @ me even or whatever, but I can tell a story about my day of cleaning up my yard after a *PERSON* rummaged through our dumpsters and made a mess of the entire block without being called out for assuming he was homeless.
As Xandar has stated that were are a million priests (if not more) and surely if one looked hard enough you would find a plethora of sin amongst them. < - > One does not need to look hard to find reliable recent articles detailing the trouble of the Catholic church worldwide as an organization rather than as a collection of a few sinful individuals.Cheers!
He was misquoted by the BBC. < - > Zionist regime and Zionist entity are one and the same.
Nah. Sorry. I disagree. This is an answer from someone privileged with beauty. Telling people that confidence is the answer to every impediment is just being lazy, and sugarcoating the harsh truth that some people are just not conventionally beautiful. https://t.co/YkGiTpIMdK < - > @_mohammadaidil_ But beauty or appearance preference are subjective per person, which we all can just agree and disagree since it fits/far off from our conceptions. Sometimes extra positivity is good for the soul :)
In all seriousness I think that possibly a mention that she has been called the R&B queen would be OK but keep it at that. < - > END OF HISTORY, and Rihanna is the R&B Queen Say what you say
I could provide counterexamples, like the Encyclopedia of Philosophy: On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. < - > I should also note that ''rejects'' is increasingly, it seems, becoming a term of art where the usage in scholarly works on philosophy is not the same as the lay reading allows - certainly if the lay reading entertains the notion that it is not expressing a certainty about a proposition.
I am not sure what would be the best word - however ethnic cleansing (though not my favorite phrase) perhaps describes the intent of the actions and uprooting (from homes/villages etc) also somewhat describes at least the portion regarding the removal of persons and forced (death) marches pretty much describes what occured from there on out. < - > ''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide?
Tea Party Republicans should have a wp article. < - > No need for any different article, but the title might lend itself to decreasing the confusion of this article.
.@RandPaul: "It almost seemed to be a little bit of glee in her voice that [Gina Haspel] actually enjoyed the torture, and I think that's not who we need to lead the @CIA... We should not reward somebody who actually participated in torture treatment." #OutnumberedOT https://t.co/k1Yyre8IlC < - > @FoxNews @RandPaul @CIA Why do Republicans run out to the media the moment they disagree with their president and let the world know all about it?!!  Tell Pres Trump privately and do what you think you must. But don't pile on to the president who has to endure constant abuse!
My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > Single version Dual version We should stay with the single CoA, as Wales & Northern Ireland are within the United Kingdom aswell.
Zbigniew Brzezinski on India in 2008. #futureforetold CC: @JustinVaisse https://t.co/V1znOgPa0G < - > @AbhijnanRej @JustinVaisse Its as much part of our histories as present situation, so  I beg to disagree, sir!
I think it's fair to say that neither is ''better'', but it's interesting to see the way the different approaches go. < - > I could see having such rendering for a print-based application, Word or something, but for a web browser, which is [i]not[/i] meant to go on paper, I think it's a terrible idea.
So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct. < - > No.
Please stop panicking that more people will die if a sentence remains in the article for more than two hours. < - > No one is panicking.
Actually, it mostly discusses CIA or American use during the Bush years (although now not mostly referring to him by name); the others are mentioned either historically or almost en passant as other repressive regimes. < - > I would reduce the amount of time this article deals with recent US waterboarding by removing the ''Controversy over classification as torture in the United States'' as well as ''As a political issue in confirmation hearings'' and ''As a political issue in 2008 presidential election''.
PUBG is still better < - > @PostMalone I have to disagree bud. But it's almost even. Exept for the fact that fortnite battle royal is free.
An actual, not figurative, LOL. The hallmark of a deranged conspiracy theorist is that all evidence, including evidence that negates the theory, is instantly converted into further proof of it. See the next tweet for the most remarkable demonstration of this. https://t.co/o32B57MdWU < - > @ggreenwald I disagree on this one. There's a clear timeline here, and while it's not definitive evidence, it certainly reeks of their influence. Within DAYS of the Exxon deal being officially cancelled Tillerson gets the axe. Many (including myself, a nobody) predicted it would happen.
From June 26, 2011; The San Diego Union-Tribune's SignOnSanDiego: Congress, put country first: End oil subsidies by John H. < - > I'd have to agree with Special:Contributions/Arthur_Rubin on this one, too vague and all-inclusive to be in just the TP movement wp article.
Third, it employs a mathematical manipulation POV (shuffling terms) that is very unreal and intuitively phony. < - > That's not a valid criticism, because the very subject of this article is fictitious forces in rotating reference frames, and these are explicitly defined as the result of ''shuffling terms'' (as you put it).
I have removed the remaining insignificant examples. < - > I think you have done a good work, but IMO ''Cultural references'' section was cleaned up a bit too much.--
#Parkland student has respectful, productive meetings with Murphy, Schumer, Speaker Ryan, Hatch, Cruz, First Lady &amp; the President in the Oval Office! But barely a mention anywhere by any of the #Florida newspaper writers? Or by most in national press? I wonder why??? < - > @marcorubio It's funny how conservatives think. One kid that actually ages with you should represent their school. 3 percent of scientists disagree about humans causing global warming, etc. You guys should give up politics and pursue a career in Cherry picking. You're a natural for the job
Unlike the rest of the Pope's exorcist's duties? < - > Yes.
You mean something like: YYYY_MM_DD has been the established date format for accessdate for over 5 years and that changing established date formats without consensus is explicitly not allowed? < - > Actually, no.
Anyway I agree with the consensus reached here; I just wanted to offer my opinion anyway. < - > I'm don't agree, but the point is moot.
My only real criticism comes in the form of the first few lines in each stanza. < - > I agree that the first five lines are wonderfully unique.
Paul Pogba is a myth < - > @Rick_avfc Disagree. Him and others there are definitely stifled by Jose.
That is simply a novel narrative that you have personally fabricated, not supported by any reputable sources, and as such it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. < - > Fugal: My treatment of Stommel and Moore follows their approach closely with numerous links that leave no doubt as to the accuracy of my portrayal of their stance.
[43] Thus what remains to be decided is whether the term terrorism or ''violent incidents'' should be used. < - > If we can't use the word terrorism, an opinion I'm sceptical about, then we must use words such as murder. People died here, that is NOT merely a violent incident.
ummmm being mean is actually VERY ugly and being nice is VERY hot! Get with the program! Hottest new trend of 2018 is being KIND !!!!!!!!! < - > @uhhmmily Being decent to one another would go a long way. Even if we all have disagreements, they should be handled in the most respectful manner. Many times have I seen people get nasty at others who simply disagree with how a problem is solved, and they lie by calling it compassion.
University lecturers are striking again in a row over pensions - after the latest round of talks between the UCU Union and employers broke down < - > @vicwhittamITV Very selfish when some people are in poverty. May be they ought to go back to learning rather than teach. Others may disagree.
Here's an example of the kind of introduction that I think would be appropriate, accurate, and NPOV for the current article. < - > I think the old intro should be used instead, and that can link to the two different articles that explain the different uses.
I'm not getting the Jordy Nelson to the Raiders deal.  Its a bad landing spot for him.  Fantasy value reduced to WR4. @TheBackRowShow @TheBLeagueSays < - > @FootballNuke @TheBLeagueSays Gotta disagree.  Crabtree will be gone afterwards and Jordy becomes top red zone threat in Oakland.  Outside of Green Bay, this is a prime spot for Jordy
Either the basis of this whole article is at risk or Darwinism is a valid entry. < - > False dichotomy.
The refs were to the LDS and AAF websites, neither reliable secondary or independent sources.-- < - > Whether a source is secondary or primary is subject to the individual.
Everyone, every NZ organisation and how they behave under our law should be scrutinised equally. https://t.co/VnSZ0uOK0o < - > @Jacky_Braid mmm, no, can't agree. those who we afford higher protection; who have the power to detain, arrest and subdue - should be scrutinised more closely.

@JuliaLopezMP - As a constituent of yours I'm increasingly concerned about the over-reaching of counter-terrorism laws to suppress freedom of speech in the UK [...] https://t.co/kFy57FN2u5 < - > @JuliaLopezMP - To be clear. I don't agree with the opinions that these three people hold but I don't believe it warrants banning entry. The UK needs to use counter-terrorism legislation to prevent terrorism and not to suppress free speech. Your thoughts would be welcome.
Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes'' 1 he has signed in to law a tax on tanning, as well as buying cigarettes (which are bought overwhelmingly by people making less than 250,000) 2 These facts should be mentioned, I think, because they have caused some controversy among his opponents, and some supporters alike.Long story short: We'll know he raised taxes on under $250,000s if and only if a reliable source says he did. < - > while technically true, I never, for one minute, believed he was including sin taxes in that too.
Sanders should explain just where he stands on guns now before he keeps using #ParklandStudents for his own political agenda.  The Last Thing Bernie Sanders Needs Right Now Is A Conversation About Guns  https://t.co/L2RhHuHQbl < - > @VABVOX He supports people rising up for what they believe. I don't agree with him on all issues but I agree big on that and respect he doesn't have public and private positions.
Consider bread production in the U.S. That's a free market. The government doesn't tell the producers how much to produce and what to charge. In other words, it's ''unregulated.'' The government doesn't regulation production and consumption. That is, bread market is a free market. There is no such thing as a capitalist system where there are no free markets. The distinguishing characteristic is free markets. < - > Take an authorative historian of capitalism and you'll see that capitalism most certainly exists without free markets. Even your bread market is regulated for food safety, quality control, price subsidies to farmers and so on - far from ''free''. But let's say that even if a free market could exist, it doesn't mean that we should make the definition of capitalism so narrow that it excludes cases where markets are regulated or ''interfered in'' by the state.
Corbyn has denounced Russia publicly many times. He's denounced the human rights abuses, the economic corruption, the political corruption. Do you not have google, Mr Maugham? https://t.co/hcVi9dSoZP < - > @simonmaginn Your options are (1) disagree with me on how he is perceived (2) disagree that it's a problem for Labour. But if I'm right that he's perceived as he is, that's not on me.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose Rebuttals to an article published in Nature need to be in a similar publication. Editors should not attempt to overrule WP:DUE by claiming special privilege for the views of a psychologist (our views on the relevance of his expertise are not relevant).
I put these two on the talk page to find out what other people think before making these significant changes that I personally dont agree with. < - > However, I am not convinced that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
Oppose: I am very cynical about peer reviews, fringe or otherwise, because I have seen too many examples of abuses and incompetence. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.

I commend you for quickly introducing legislation to avoid same horrible tragedy, after a dog died on an airline. I hope it passes. It would be nice if you and your colleagues would pass legislation to avoid same horrible tragedy after 17 kids and faculty were killed at a school. https://t.co/RWlONWffm5 < - > @ananavarro I agree, it is a shame that a pet dies on a plane. Dog owner had a right to disagree and get off the flight, however the 17 people who were massacred didn't have that choice, and what bill did he rush to file after that tragedy? Both bills would be welcomed.
You guys breathe pesticides on a daily basis. < - > Many of our towns and parks are ''pesticide free zones''.
I link to Zionist regime, which is very clear for anyone to see in edit history, unlike what you say which is completely untrue. < - > I couldn't find it.
There is no need for this statement whatsoever, there is no need to make it look like that the innocent Israelis are the victims in this conflict.I would also add, if it hasn't been said, that WP:TERRORIST isn't a policy, it's a style guideline, and one that allows exceptions. < - > I didn't say ''Hamas is a terrorist organization'' (though it is), but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics, which is 100% true and accurate, and not open to interpretation.

Well, maybe it's something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points, and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect. < - > Actually, it was in early autumn...
For one thing, if they can't be criticisms, then I think you'll have a tough time explaining why his citizenship is mentioned on a page of its own. < - > The birther stuff is somewhere between a fringe conspiracy theory and a political smear.
I think having the Origins and Mission paragraph at the top is the most logical place - it tells the reader where the church came from and why it is here. < - > In short, I think the Origins and mission section is redundant.
Seems that people that like mindless action and stuff blowing up like Rogue One the best. Those that like a story and interesting characters like The Last Jedi more. Different fans.  Both right < - > @StarWarsJunk @MentorSkywalker Respectfully, I disagree.  I love a great story and interesting characters.  The problem I had with the Last Jedi is that the story was taken in the wrong direction, in my opinion.  I do not believe that Luke would have responded in the way he did.  I had other issues but Twitter

Apples and oranges aside, this appears to be how the Vatican views the landscape, and as such, this event constitutes a tremendous psychological milestone from both the Muslim and the Roman Catholic point-of-view. < - > I find it a meaningless statement.

Whatever. < - > I never accused you of racism.
However, judging by the above, the Salon article is about Hamas and the ripost does belong in our WP article. < - > No, the Salon article was about Israel making the 'deliberate close proximity to civilians' charge against Hezbollah during the Israel-Lebanon conflict in 2006.
It is so hard to try and keep up with all of the issues regarding the ''fight'' soo in lieu I just started a new section for it completely, and therefore, conversing can be continued following, and singularily regarding the ''fight''. < - > I don't feel that the incident yet deserves its own section, and sectioning it off in such a way would just encourage further recentism and tabloidesque details.

in this case it obviously important and add understanding for reader who click link to see what ''Zionist regime'' refer to''. < - > I give up on anti-semitic link, not big deal.
You won't find the term in the Catechism, while there is a good deal of overlap with the principles. < - > Also on the topic of homosexuality, this is the official, from the Catechism stance of the Church.
Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537, and I don't think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls. < - > The book said that large numbers of people were on the missions, but weren't officially baptized until after the pope's ruling.
I had a lot of comments beyond the two that Nancy pulled out to ask for consensus about, and I thought it would be easier for those working to update the article to put those with any other PR comments than have them here on the talk page. < - > Yeah, but now if someone new does look at the peer review page they may decide taht since it appears to have already been reviewed, they may as well look at some other article.
Should I put my account private? First I got harassed by Snyder fans by liking JL and not BVS. Now I'm getting harassed by MCU fans by first liking the Amazing Spider-Man movies and hating Spider-Man 3. Also for prefering WW over Logan. < - > @matigordillo99 The way I see it, I don't let people bother me. Everyone's entitled to their opinion. If we disagree, it's fine so long as they're not rude something. And if somebody does get too obnoxious, there's always the option of blocking them.

Brews, there seems to be something wrong about your remark that: ''The point is that the most common viewpoint and the one basic to the view of such texts as Taylor and of Arnol'd and of Landau and Lifshitz and of Whittiker is the one based upon centrifugal forces that vanish in a non-rotating frame, and are present in a rotating frame. < - > Hi Harald: There are two approaches to handling rotating frames.
But whether or not this view of the proper scope of this list is agreed to be an appropriate bound, I've removed Darwinism. < - > First off, the inclusion criteria that allow darwinism are here: 'Besides explicitly using the word ''pseudoscience'', some may also have used synonyms that help to explain why they consider a topic to be pseudoscientific.
I think there is a good reason to have a fork but am not sure Hypnosadist has chosen the best title for the forked material. < - > I' don't see a justification for a fork.

I support our President overall but if I'm not able to call out specifically instances where I don't agree with him how can we as a party grow?

Second, because a regime can change and the entity remains (exactly as MA points out in his comparable example - the Shah regime of iran'' < - > But saying that the zionist regime and the zionist entity are distinct is wrong.
I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''. < - > Again, all fictitious forces are ''coordinate based'', so it makes no sense to call some of them ''coordinate based'' and others ''state of motion based''. That is simply a novel narrative that you have personally fabricated, not supported by any reputable sources, and as such it doesn't belong in Wikipedia.
Money/locker room things aside, Crabtree is a better player than Nelson at this moment in time. https://t.co/wnTN7p7063 < - > @MattHarmon_BYB I have to respectfully disagree with you Matt.
Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama's biography, but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not. This section should be cut down to two or three sentences at the most. < - > I'm not saying what I wrote can't be improved upon, I'm saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter, if it then makes it lopsided, is not the answer here.And to Wikidemon's already beginning editing, regardless of the colloquial use of their former name, they are not actually called ''British Petroleum''.
There are also little wording issues like The hostile criticisms of the Reformation which insert a subtle POV. < - > I'm sorry Karanacs, I disagree with your proposal.
Crucial to understanding this article is this sentence from the 2nd paragraph.: ''This article will start with what have been some widely accepted, but still in various ways mistaken or misleading, definitions of atheism and move to more adequate formulations that better capture the full range of atheist thought and more clearly separate unbelief from belief and atheism from agnosticism.'' That crucial sentence thus also applies to other things he has said in the very 1st paragraph, such as: ''Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not, professing to find the questions unanswered or unanswerable.'' that crucial sentence also specifically says '' and more clearly separate... atheism from agnosticism'' It is also worth noting that while saying they are distinguished, he does not really yet say HOW they are distinguished - he just gives a general description of agnosticism.-- < - > Sorry JimWae, but it is difficult to express just how extraordinary a claim that is without seeming insulting.
How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today. In recent years, abuse of minors by representatives of the Catholic church made headlines throughout the world, further tarnishing the church's image.'' < - > That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion, contraception and euthanasia though, which I feel is important to point out if we're going to directly address those issues. It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought.
You're just trying to give undue weight to your interpretation of this particular topic. < - > I'm specifically trying NOT to give undue weight to any particular view of the subject.
Safaricom has CONSISTENTLY abused its dominant position in the market to offer below quality services while stifling competition through unfair practises. Safaricom should be declared a dominant player with more than 80% market share. We should stop paling around with it. < - > @RobertAlai Let disagree politely.....safaricom has contributed a lot into our lives....consider first their mpesa services....if you doubt try a reversal with airtelmoney...secondly there services are available everywhere...remember one inconvenience can't make us shan n paint something bad
Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion. < - > @DavidRoads i disagree. there are certain things and situations that are factually impossible for a person or people to do. that does not mean, however, that the impossible will remain so forever
However, as far as I know, the negotiations between Britain and the USSR (and later the US) were not about Soviet entry into some existing alliance (no such am alliance existed by that moment), but about the formation of new alliance (''The Grand Alliance''). < - > It seems uncontroversial to say that 'The USSR joined the Allies' - the 'Allies' of World War II were a temporary grouping which wasn't centred around formal treaties.
Of course Bevel is co-equal to Dr. < - > For the moment, the available sources clearly indicate that historians simply do not consider him a ''first-tier leader of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement'' on or close to par with King.
The Marleau ref discusses provincial politics, and the sentence I moved it from already has two other refs supporting it. The 1983 ref is outdated, and its information is already covered by the other two refs covering the same information. The GG ref covers the information from both of the refs it replaces, neither of which were particularly vital. < - > I do not see how removing those perfectly good references serves any purpose.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose The edit conflict seems to be between a small group, who are trying to give fringe sources parity with reliable ones, and a larger group determined to maintain the distinction between the two. The consensus seems clear to me; I don't think ''consensus'' is synonymous with ''unanimity.''--
Consensus doesn't mean that everyone has to agree, it simply means that the majority of quality sources do. < - > You have also failed to establish that the EB article represents a ''consensus'' view as opposed to the particular conceptualisation of one particular writer.
And, also indirect ownership such as a loan from a bank results in profit going to the bank and those that supplied the money to purchase the means of production (and distribution). < - > I do draw the line on your second point, though. A bank loan is not ''indirect ownership''. It is debt, not equity, there is no claim of ownership, indirect or otherwise. The bank receives interest, not profit - although that interest is indeed deducted from the profit that would otherwise go to the capital owners.
Govt is right to take action to dismantle Russian intelligence capability in UK, to agree now to the Magnitsky amendment, and to work through UN to expose Russia for deeply serious breaches of international law, chemical weapons prohibition &amp; human rights. < - > @YvetteCooperMP I disagree with you on just about everything, but the stance of you and your colleagues on this is admirable, welcome and badly needed.
2) The term Second lady is seldom used in the press today. < - > 2: I don't know why your Lexis search failed to find usage of the term ''second lady'', but I was immediately able to find recent usage of this title like: I particularly like her May 30th, 2005 interview with Larry King, where Mrs.

Constructive discussion: WP:TALK via [ [47]]. < - > No legitimate suggestions of article improvement, just hand-wringing about ''liberals'' and SAT scores.I find it all over Wikipedia, but especially in the political arena, whether it's a politician or a political commentator or whatnot.
It is a violation of WP:SYNTH, as well as a logical fallacy known as poisoning the well. < - > There is no SYNTH, as the reference is to Israel making precisely the same charge made against another paramilitary group.
So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other? < - > First, I note again your non-response to the substantive question (which perhaps is just as well, considering that your previous response gives ample evidence of your level of understanding of this subject). Second, for the billionth time, you are entitled to pass judgement on what is ''normal'', and wikipedia policy is NOT to limit articles to just the ''most common'' point of view, but to represent all notable points of view to be found in reputable sources. Hence your comments are completely misguided.
Currently there are listed a wealth of sources which seem to support that atheism is indeed dogmatic - no matter if some people may have called themselves atheists without understanding what the word actually meant. < - > Or, indeed, ''no matter'' if some people may have called other people atheists without understanding what the word actually meant.
Confrontational implies attitude and having a bone to pick, when sometimes just saying the truth  is effective enough. < - > Well...normally I think of confrontational as in...someone has a problem with me and rather than let it exist, I do something about it (for better or worse).
High quality sourcing is available on this topic, so WP:Parity doesn't apply, and per WP:DUE, including a paragraph from fringe astrological journals in equal size to our summary of Nature is inappropriate. < - > You are right in the sense that ''Astrologers disagree'' with Carlson's conclusions - though that statement invites the comment - they would, wouldn't they? The case for the criticisms of Carlson is stronger than that. If you follow the threads you will see that in this instance, two of the psychology professors Eysenck and Ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write ''Scientists disagree...'' or ''Psychologists disagree ...''.
A lot of pettiness on the right.  Here's 1 example.   You make a video, send it to a Conservative publication, they ignore it.  Someone else copies the video you made &amp; your tactic &amp; then the ppl who you sent your video to cover the other video instead.  The right is not united. < - > @LauraLoomer I was just having this convo after some serious Twitter drama involving #maga folks last night.  The Left is like glue. Sadly, we're held together by spit. Pettiness, jealousy &amp; if we have ANY areas we disagree, we can't agree to do so, and stand fast. We block &amp; malign. Not good
Whether it's claiming George Soros is paying protesters, or saying a student-conceived, student-led day of national protest is an insidious liberal scam, the right just can't believe anyone would stick their neck out for someone other than themselves https://t.co/WUOrW9jZca < - > @AndyRichter With respect, I disagree. The right's campaign has been built around othering and fear. The prospect of teenagers, a group already considered pretty alien by adults, organising something like this in such a way as to offer no adult real access, well that engenders fear.
#OHGov candidate @RichCordray fought to allow guns at the Statehouse. #OHGov candidate @Dennis_Kucinich is fighting to keep guns out of our classrooms. It's a clear choice.  #NationalWalkoutDay #NationalSchoolWalkout #NRABloodMoney @Emma4Change @ForParkland https://t.co/GfOCorDtj2 < - > @OH4Kucinich @NM_Butler @RichCordray @Dennis_Kucinich @Emma4Change @ForParkland This is a first amendment issue. You can't shut down speech you don't agree with because you don't agree with it and, yes, marching around with guns is speech.   Good lord, people.
Single version Dual version We should stay with the single CoA, as Wales & Northern Ireland are within the United Kingdom aswell. < - > You've lost me GoodDay; N.Ireland and Wales are represented on both sets of arms and neither (currently) have a version of UK arms specific to them, unlike Scotland.
Twila Barnes on @SenWarren's heritage: "Many [Native Americans] are angry because they feel like she's appropriating an identity to gain something from that, and she has no respect for true Native Americans." #Tucker https://t.co/w927qe2fOT < - > @FoxNews @SenWarren Don't disagree with the issue surrounding the controversy, but she is not a genealogist. She has no certification, or background. My mom uses https://t.co/ku0lU5FtZC so I guess she is one too?
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump You fire everyone who "disagrees with you with a Tweet . Any news you  don't agree with is " fake "   Your wife is about to take on an " anti bullying campaign ..  She needs to start with your Twitter Account ..
We shouldn't ''whitewash'' the article just because some things may be controversial. < - > I was attempting to answer what appeared to be a genuine question from a first-time poster without making incendiary remarks, not ''whitewashing'' anything.
The only reason why atheists do not like Christianity this day in age is the supposed moral restrictions. Nothing at all with scientific set backs. < - > @ArkadyChoi not true, in america christians try to put their religious beliefs in schools, their symbols on public property and disparage those that don't agree with them
While AIDS is frightening, I don't think that it needs any assistance in being more frightening. < - > If you're suggesting that the tone of the current article is fear-mongering, then I disagree.
.@SteveScalise: "What we saw in Parkland was an example of so many breakdowns in government."  https://t.co/7iSOarZCKa https://t.co/7cJWVqIDAD < - > @FoxNews @SteveScalise i disagree. what we saw that Trump should had passed Obama's version of gun control than his own lame excuse gun control. Also, alt-RIGHT republican should had passes it 2.
As a courtesy in the future, please share your sources rather than simply delete material. < - > I don't know why you claim I'm providing citations, when they have already been pointed out.
I think it's fair to say that neither is ''better'', but it's interesting to see the way the different approaches go. < - > I understand the point, but I think Apple's ''making the fonts look nice'' make the fonts look terrible.
Please don't get angry. Get your PVC. Let's vote out President Muhammadu Buhari @MBuhari and his incompetence the way we voted out former President Jonathan and his incompetence.  They can then compare notes on incompetence at their expense not at ours https://t.co/WOGEeubIM3 < - > @AishaYesufu @MBuhari I disagree. Chibok girls were kidnapped April 2014, clueless Jonathan visited military formations in North east 6 weeks to the elections 2015 in military uniform..not the Govt sec school Chibok. PMB has visited Dapchi school few weeks after he deployed FG delegations and IG. https://t.co/9MKbvVAZ9N
If you care about some random, self-named person posting an obscure stream on a platform most don't use and setting streaming records for doing absolutely nothing of substance...it may be time to reexamine priorities. < - > @WillReeveJr You very well may be right about the longevity of the platform, unless Amazon and Twitch have anything to say about it. But "substance" is subjective. And whether they last for a year or 100, the millions of people using it daily would disagree about its importance --- TO THEM
Am I too forward? < - > too forward?
Really surprised about all these veteran running backs getting deals. When you take a look at the entire landscape, it's going to be hard to find large workhorse-type roles for the running backs in this draft class. < - > @MikeTagliereNFL Disagree. Point to Vikes and Latavius Murray signing, even though they invested, more than happy to hand the keys over to Dalvin Cook before injury. Teams just value having depth.
no, its a system of supple and demand. < - > But you seem confused between capitalists and landlords. Different roles, different earnings. A landlord can charge rent even if he did not put an ounce of work into the place. Just the mere fact of ownership of limited land. Look up the concept of ''rent''.
Ok so twitter just locked my account &amp; forced me to delete this tweet https://t.co/Xwyggl276b < - > @TRobinsonNewEra Not sure if you've heard this but Islam is actually a religion of peace, so much so that if you disagree we will silence you until compliance.
Either the basis of this whole article is at risk or Darwinism is a valid entry. < - > The basis of this article is not at risk.
Rock, like Shut Up And Drive and Rihanna says the next album will be more Rock and Punk < - > Just because shut up and drive has rock influences does not generalize her into being a rock singer.
I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise). < - > ''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.
Here's an example of the kind of introduction that I think would be appropriate, accurate, and NPOV for the current article. < - > I object strenuously to your proposal and have given my reasons, which you pooh-pooh as misguided and as already dealt with by your snow job of vague allusions to wonderful arguments made in the distant past, with refutations blithely ignored.
Amazing to me how you can say this in agreement re: Randle while crushing Kanter at will lol. https://t.co/ioDUtf4uoj < - > @ThomasCDee Kanter and KP does not work.  If you think KP won't come back but we should build around Kanter then fine, I don't agree however.
And there's nothing wrong with being a ''narrow-minded, ignorant bigot''. < - > There is EVERYTHING wrong with being a bigot.
They're proud of it, in fact.Israel did everything possible to avoid civilian casualties, but it can't be 100% accurate when fighting against terrorists hiding among the civilian population. < - > The fact that Israel dropped bombs on civilian areas in one of the most densely populated regions of the world is overwhelming evidence that the intent was to kill civilians.
My favorite one is the "we aren't having it" one. https://t.co/qlCbw81sC4 < - > @amazingatheist I don't agree that old Lara Croft was "a sexist, over-the-top cartoon character in the initial version of the game" just cause she was busty doesn't make her sexist. She was a cartoonish over the top character perhaps but giving her big boobs isn't sexist.
Close - but ''God exists'' is not what is being sought a referent for, God is, and reference failure isn't ''can be neither true or false'', that is the property that it has for not referring to anything. < - > Once again, the referent that has not been obtained is the one for ''God'', not God.--
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article.
I simply propose adding 200 words that reflect Lederer's article, which is cited at length on the Denialism page, so how controversial can it be? < - > Sorry Martindo, the talk page is the precise place to float a controversial change, not the article itself.
With the U.S. Treasury Department now issuing sanctions directly related to Robert Mueller's investigation, it makes it nearly impossible for Trump to justify firing Mueller.  If he does, then he is impeding upon the best interests of the United States! < - > @EdKrassen Disagree. I think he is going to use it as part of the pretext for shutting Mueller down.  The old strategy was deny anything happened.  New strategy is, yes the Russians interfered, but no collusion, see House intelligence cmte, and now we punished them, so game over.
Emphasizing private ownership of capital is hardly glorifying; indeed, it is Marx's number one point. < - > As for private property, I disagree with Marx, changing which entity legally owns the means of production does not necessarily change the underlying mode of production. The PRC's or Singapore's large state sectors are evidence enough of this, although they are publicly owned, they still operate for a profit and often reinvest this profit into the economy, the wage-system (which Marx considered to be a defining feature of capitalism) still remains in place as workers are still exploited in the Marxian sense (China is described as capitalist or state capitalist by non-socialist and non-Marxist commentators and political scientists).
I swear the way some people criticize others beats my understanding...   And then how are you gonna give a someone compliment and then say something offensive, like "aww,shes sweet but shes blonde and damn" because she doesnt talk about the things you want to hear.. < - > If you dont agree with something that someone else is doing or saying, then just dont comment, cos then it makes you just seem really ignorant...
Left with the stories fed by the poor quality media coverage, many Americans were mistakenly led to believe that Terry was ''brain dead,'' in a coma, or in a ''persistive vegetative state.'' If the media had covered Terri's plight the way they did the aftermath of Katrina, perhaps she would have had a bit of a fighting chance. < - > A fighting chance?
The argument about authors being able to get ''their objections published in equally respected journals'' has been addressed a few times here and as stated in WP:PARITY ''Parity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia'' This is the case with research into astrology, not because of the quality of the research or the credentials of the researchers but the nature of the subject. < - > That's not correct, Robert. There are a number of reliable secondary sources that could be used instead.
So Rand Paul will vote against Trump's pick for Secretary of state and CIA? This is why a lot of Republican voters aren't showing up at the voting booths. They are sick and tired of this. Going against Trump only serves to injure the party. Rand Paul must go. enough is enough < - > @1776Stonewall Rand has no other platform but to disagree! It seems that's the only way he can get media attention. Pompeo is the best choice for SOS, should be a shoo-in for the job! Gina is the best choice to become director! Rand needs to get off his high horse &amp; show respect for them!
More than anything it appears as a gateway site to the work of scholars that address their topic of interest.It is acceptable to quote reliable sources on Wikipedia. < - > Even if a webmaster or editor is reputable, that doesn't mean their website has been fact-checked.
Oppose inclusion, per Siafu. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
For god's sake- a man and his daughter and a policeman are in hospital as a result of a chemical weapon attack on our soil. If this is your response to serious and complex debate about how best to respond its time to definitely take some time out from social media. https://t.co/xzzKCI6Rrp < - > @stellacreasy Whereas the tweet you've retweeted is certainly not constructive discourse, the response to Corbyn in the commons was hardly constructive either. France and Nato seem to largely agree with Corbyn, maybe others could explain in a constructive fashion why they disagree?
I hope Levine can explain what he was trying to say because to me Levine seemed to be saying that authorities on pseudoscience are pseudoscientific themselves.Regarding, ''Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science. < - > I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy/authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren't pseudoscience (a reliable source for describing what is and what isn't pseudoscience), then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP:PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific.
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules. < - > The characterization regarding the use of the term terrorism on Wikipedia (''not allowed'') is incorrect.
That having been said, I'd probably consider Safari if I wanted to print a web page and make it look nice. < - > If you want to print a webpage and make it look nice, it shouldn't matter what browser you're using (unless one has terrible layout issues for printed pages) as the proper better printed font rendering will be used in each case.
If we MUST name Ireland and Britain with a group name, why not name it something less controversial, like ''West European Isles''. < - > It's not the business of Wikipedia to prescribe ''correct'' usage; as a matter of fact the term ''British Isles'' is being used for Britain and Ireland.
Dragon Ball is not a comedic prequel to Dragon Ball Z.  If you want a real comedic prequel: every Lil Wayne album before the Carter. < - > @EmperorBigD I disagree. The albums predating the Carter were the sound at those times and shouldnt really be laughed at
Fuck Lil Xan https://t.co/xgEjNAXeL8 < - > @ImJustCody I love him so much but I disagree with his views on Tupac lol
Sometimes you must marketbuy so that the price doesnt run away from you all because you wanted to save a few satoshis < - > @bitcoinbella Let the trades come to you homegirl. Unless it's a long term play, then I agree. The few sats don't matter much.
GBooks links would add nearly 15 kB of raw text. < - > Canada - Document statistics File size: 560 kB Prose size (including all HTML code): 100 kB References (including all HTML code): 16 kB Wiki text: 135 kB Prose size (text only): 47 kB (7318 words) ''readable prose size'' References (text only): 1194 B Nikki, on the BRD front, you are wrong.
I understand the #Patriots have bigger needs than WR. They also have $20 million in cap space and very few options left to spend it on. They're going to address the defense in the draft. They can easily afford a WR like Crabtree. < - > @ezlazar I respectfully disagree. They have NO need for another WR. Cooks, Edelman, Hogan, Britt, Dorsett, and I really want to see if Riley McCarron can play. A lot of buzz around him last summer/fall.
Actually we do need to mention the different POV's mentioned in the article. A good introduction summarizes the contents of the article. < - > No, there are too many views and the differences are complex. It is a long enough article. The intro does introduce the article, and it states what the main issues of difference are (what is private property, which markets are how free), anything more specific would get too overwrought.
Why of all things? Why did they bring the muppet back? One of the biggest improvements of the prequals... and they brought the muppet back. He was 50% comic relief. < - > Luke is great tho. Everyone saying Luke is bad in TLJ I disagree.  He is like the deciple of a great sage having the duty of passing on his knowledge and growing frustrated by his inability. Giving up at his first mistake as a teacher and resigning himself to hermitude.  1/2
Yes. You fight guns with guns. Cowards who think they are attacking an unarmed population (school, concert, etc.) attack these places BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY UNARMED AND HELPLESS. It needs to change. Harden the target. #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/QuoP85Lk8c < - > @LeahRBoss End of discussion because she disagrees wuth you. Her way or no way. I love how the left fights. If you don't agree with their opinion, you can't possibly be right and you should just stop talking.
All African Bantu cultures are almost identical &amp; languages are similar. We all greet strangers. We pay Lobola when we get married, u call any woman ur age sister, any man ur age brother, a man ur father's age father, a woman ur mother's age mother. Differences are superficial. < - > @TebogoDitshego I agree with you, I'll just disagree with the 'bantu' description. Bantu is a colonial term to dehumanize the meaning of the word abantu-batho-watu sub-humanize Africans.
I've read people twisting notcypher's words and telling her to choke just because she showed her opinion (which is not wrong but you only see your side, right?) y'all only need a word to start hating and that's pitiful, you can be so irrational, hypocritical, and individualistic < - > it's not because you don't agree with someone's opinion that that allows you to be impolite, rough and disrespectful, no one deserves to receive that much hatred for something so small but I guess y'all don't give a shit about other people's feelings
PatrioticHippie, the problem with your attempt to correct perceived errors with Wikipedia is that your claims are incredibly vague. < - > No legitimate suggestions of article improvement, just hand-wringing about ''liberals'' and SAT scores.I find it all over Wikipedia, but especially in the political arena, whether it's a politician or a political commentator or whatnot.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR Then shame on me gladly.  I encourage all Americans to participate in peaceful protest. And, respect others who disagree with them-unlike you.
For him to have made a comparison of how he is handling Dapchi abduction with how Chibok abduction was handled  by PDP GEJ government is a clear case of PMB not growing above party sentiments as a President! Sad, very sad. @NigeriainfoFM @tolulopeab @liborous < - > @simplysune14 @NigeriainfoFM @tolulopeab @liborous I disagree with you The first false imagination by you guys is that you think h4 doesn't get the gist of what's being discussed in the media The media &amp; some NGO's started d comparison immediately d Dapchi crisis happened, wc he got wind of and this is his way of replying
San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks, with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there, so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead. < - > ''special protections codified into law...so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead.'' There is no mention in the article of special protections.
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead. < - > Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas.
The firing of rockets seems to me to be a desperate measure to resist an ongoing occupation that has imposed a blockade with catastrophic consequences for the Palestinian people. < - > Two words - suicide bombers.
Ed Willes: You can't put a dollar value on hosting a World Cup #bcpoli #soccer  https://t.co/aFtQntdtE7 < - > @jasjohalbc So you disagree with your friends over at Global BC @DOUBLEJGLOBALBC  and @sbarnesglobal ?? You are nothing more thank a barking seal. Pathetic. #bcpoli
The Russell ref is nearly 30 years old, and given that the fairly uncontroversial sentence that it was used for already has two valid refs I see no reason to include it; similarly, the Montpetit ref was supporting uncontroversial information already well-cited, so I moved it to support other information that was less so. < - > There's no need to delete these references. And the Government of Canada is not a publisher; all federal government material is published by the Queen's Printer for Canada.
The article states that ''As of 2004, the vast majority of worldwide sex abuse cases have been in the United States'' - would you agree to that? < - > The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S. is 'investigational bias'.
I've removed some insensitive comments, the result of which were to offend some editors here and to distract the talk page from discussing the content of the article. < - > Your removals are unwarranted. I have violated no rules. It is not incumbent upon me to ensure that a group of Asperger's sufferers (and I have no doubt this page attracts far more editors with Asperger's than any other group) are not offended by statements of fact, and I have stated nothing but fact.
Currently, the lede states that ''The USSR joined the Allies''. < - > So yes, ''The USSR joined the Allies'' is correct.
You, on the other hand, just seem to use this talk page as a platform on which to display your ego as you bash about the head visiting genocide denialists. < - > I discount your mischaracterization of my contributions here.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Mutations, by themselves, will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones.
Science confirms Genesis Flood account, again https://t.co/ha8k2sboNC < - > @DavidBartonWB Others would disagree: https://t.co/FhYNVemtA7
It will be Caste vs Hindutva in 2019. And #Mayawati will be pursued by both sides. My piece in @washingtonpost https://t.co/ADG0jpAGnT < - > @BDUTT @washingtonpost Disagree. People will vote for NM the Most. Caste,Hindutva will all take back Seat.
Because that is not the common name. < - > @MacTire ''Britain and Ireland'' is common name though.
But others simply use ''non-Indo-European'', which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn't changed since primeval times; so I'd prefer to use ''non-Indo-European'' rather than ''pre-Indo-European''. < - > Dumu, I'm not sure how you figure we can't say with a fair amount of certainty it's pre-IE.
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > No, it hasn't been agreed upon by all users yet.
Once again, all fictitious forces are ''coordinate dependent things'', so your comment is a complete non-sequitur. < - > No.
And there's nothing wrong with being a ''narrow-minded, ignorant bigot''. < - > There is EVERYTHING wrong with being a bigot.
This episode is with @Abraha3am, the co-founder of @Muslimish. Ibrahim is a firebrand ex-Muslim activist who is known for his fiery speeches and no-holds-barred criticisms of #Islam, the #Quran, and all religion in general. https://t.co/RGj5OIiL43 < - > @SecularJihadist @ArminNavabi @Abraha3am @Muslimish Armin, I agree 100% that words have meanings &amp; we should expect those meaning to b enforced. If u don't meet the most basic definition of a Muslim than don't call yourself one. The more self described Muslims the more powerful Islam becomes.  There is strength in numbers.
I'm very concerned whether this article should be at ''Black people'' at all. To my mind it seems a very patronising and unencyclopedic 1950s term, and classifies a diverse group solely by an inaccurate description of their skin colour. < - > I'm black and I don't find this offensive at all.
House of Lords TRIGGERED over Tommy Robinson Presence https://t.co/x4pRVE7fTq < - > @TRobinsonNewEra Extreme?? But not the returing jihadists or imams with anti-western/terror sympathies. Only Tommy and the people who speak on the truth of islam. Does the House of Lords have nothing better to discuss than "hate speech"?? Which is to say discussing thoughts they disagree with.
Ironic how school campuses want safe spaces so students' feelings don't get hurt....but no safety when it comes to protecting them physically. #SecureOurSchools #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @DeepSouthProud Well, and in many cases, no safety when it comes to exercising their rights to free speech if they disagree with the powers in charge of the schools!
The template image seems to advance Europhilia and anti-Americanism in that the euro symbol is placed in front of the dollar despite the fact that the United states is a larger and more powerful economic force than the EU. < - > You could argue that either of those promotes one over the other. As such, I don't think it's worth arguing about; it's just a symbol, and not intended to have some deeper symbolism than representing economics using two of the most prominent currencies.
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts, which is not criticism at all. < - > What I actually said was that if criticisms are notable and reliably sourced, then they should be included, and that consensus without a valid objection, such as on the basis of sourcing or notability, should not be enough to prevent the subject's mention.
Of course religion is a social construct, but you don't need to make ridiculous claims about babies being atheists to make that argument. < - > Oh I wish. Its not even that simple. Shiver, because its not entirely a fad. The suffix of -ism can simply define a state or condition and not only simply a belief or position. I think this is why we can talk about non-theism and have an article on nontheism. Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
When are real Americans going to stand up to these repulsive pricks? https://t.co/DY6DR2unaM < - > @piersmorgan Don't agree with most of the things you say @piersmorgan but your spot on here. Sadly if the president won't stand up to them I don't see any change whatsoever.
Given that the version of the UK CoA used in Scotland is a CoA of the UK and not the CoA of Scotland, and that a single image exists which displays both that version used in Scotland and elsewhere, the image showing both versions should appear in the info-box as both are a Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. < - > Keep the single image, with a note as suggested, linking to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom article.
LaSalle St is sleepy on a Saturday morning, but I'm working!  Join me on @CNN with @smerconish at 9am ET. https://t.co/S9R53kvAkg < - > @CortesSteve @CNN @smerconish @CortesSteve, I disagree with pretty much everything you say on @CNN ... to the point I searched for you on here.  Now that I see we're both from Chicago, I appreciate your style more. We'll agree to disagree on politics, but perhaps agree on baseball?  GO CUBS!  What say you?
The Agony, Ecstasy, And Futility Accompanying Indian Elections  @ARanganathan72  https://t.co/cK77XVZZAG < - > @SwarajyaMag @ARanganathan72 i don't agree with most of it. election is vital in its own way. this cynical approach makes everything meaningless to say it briefly.
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules. < - > The characterization regarding the use of the term terrorism on Wikipedia (''not allowed'') is incorrect.
Me: hey Michael B Jordan: https://t.co/pLnfWMCzlX < - > @trillValentine Strongly disagree
Given that disambiguation pages properly disambiguate terms and articles aren't about terms (that's what dictionaries do), it's probably never going to be a proper encyclopedia article.- ( < - > The whole ''dictionary'' canard has been debunked long ago. (This isn't about bark.) The subject of centrifugal force, including its variety of meanings, both as it has evolved through history, and in current usage, is itself a subject.
In addition, GBooks links are not available to everyone - they depend on a number of factors, including geographic location (as some countries have stricter copyright laws than others - Google limits viewing capabilities to comply with local rules) and how much you use Google Books (if you use it too much you'll run into a viewing limit, in which case these links could not work at all or could (in the case of page-specific links) lead to the wrong page). < - > The last argument, that some people won't benefit from the links, is unpersuasive.
My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > The text states ''the Great Seal of England be used as the Great Seal of the United Kingdom'' etc., so I think it would be best to keep that one in the infobox.
It's very good, but not even as good as the game it's directly copying or like a dozen other games from last year https://t.co/tTXNoBWunK < - > @Cosmis I disagree, it's a very good game, but I think Donkey Kong is the best game ever.
The (on-campus) vigils are student-lead, voluntary &amp; approved by the Springdale School District. https://t.co/nDddnYpxCn < - > @5NEWSAlex I would WANT my child to participate in the walkout. I disagree with detention, and am shocked to hear students were threatened with expulsion. Activism should not be punished! This is for something bigger than us!
The sociological article is quite clear in establishing a usage that is the same as the other sources I have posted above, namely ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'', feel free to offer sources that you feel support your claim that there is not a consensus established about this by quality sources. < - > I could provide counterexamples, like the Encyclopedia of Philosophy: On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. Some other counterexamples are cited in Wiktionary:Citations:atheist and Wiktionary:Citations:atheism, which chronicle each sense of those words being used for centuries.
As phenomena on Earth clearly do work (which requires energy), a part of the energy is not lost into space but rather does work on Earth. < - > On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths).
Today, my school held a walkout for the gun violence that has been occurring in the U.S.  I do believe that gun violence is an issue that the government needs to fix.    Students should not have to go to school in fear of getting shot and losing their lives. < - > I don't care if you disagree with me, but innocent lives are being taken because of people who decide to misuse guns.   I believe bullying plays a large part in this as well. Some teachers don't listen when you are bullied then they wonder why kids bring guns.
I don't know what people expect.  We elected Trump to get the job done and he is running the country like a business.  If you aren't doing your job the way it needs to be done then you are fired.  Thats the way it should be. #Tillerson   #YoureFired   #SOTSwamp https://t.co/C70w3oJ212 < - > @SickOfTheSwamp @Tamara09932546 Totally agree! Just cause he replaced someone doesn't mean there is chaos! If he finds they disagree with his AGENDA he has a right to fire them. He wants his people behind him 100%
The original Dark Souls is still the standard for a cleverly-interconnected world, IMO. Everything feels organically baked in as one world, as opposed to numerous areas strung together and separated by obvious gates. < - > @mistermegative Yea, I can't really disagree, at least considering what style of game it is. A lack of interconnectivity is probably one of my extremely few complaints about Bloodborne.
Childhood is a series of events you didn't realize were traumatizing until much later. < - > @SirEviscerate @abstex Disagree.
We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina. < - > The original wording was off base, as I believe are the comparisons to Katrina.
So the IMDB says Rihanna The Queen Of The R&B... < - > IMDB is not a reliable source.
I doubt the average American uses it either as most Americans cannot tell the difference between England and Britain. It is only common name in Britain, which means, on a World scale, it's not actually common name at all. < - > You seem so sure it's not a common name. Prove it.
Abby is asleep on my lap right now and she's snoring. < - > i bet that dog is NOT snoring.
Challenging inequality through the arts in the UKs most unequal city. @michaelejudge and I will be talking at @CAN_Cambridge conference at @AngliaRuskin on 23rd March  https://t.co/ER3HYLDXQ2 https://t.co/m1JeDaJdez < - > @MsHilaryCox @michaelejudge @CAN_Cambridge @AngliaRuskin @MyCambs @camcitco @Akua_OF @PFACreate @ParksideC_SLS Is the unequal city you refer to Cambridge? Because I think many individuals would disagree.
-I agree that the full Nicene Creed should stay. < - > I think readers who are unfamiliar with the RCC or other Christian religions which use the Nicene Creed won't necessarily understand what it is saying.
The WP:RS are unanimous: HIV causes AIDS. < - > There are Reliable Sources the world over who dissent on this topic, therefore, it is NOT unanimous.
It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > The majority of editors involved here had an other opinion.--
This is not a list of topics that are characterized as a pseudoscience in light of current, or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method. < - > First off, this is not properly a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by somebody at some point in time for all of history, but rather is properly presented as a list of topics that are characterized a pseudoscience in light of current, or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method.
i mean who wants to read about my life, it's boring... < - > I mean, I do really like the pictures because I'm more visually oriented, and I am happy that you'll be posting more photos, but I like to read about your life too.
I don't know why the Japanese bishop hired a man for some unknown job when he had been accused of reading pornography as a student. < - > It is Yakima, WA in the good old U.S.A.
''Canada's status as a Dominion within the British Empire ended with Parliament's independent declaration of war on Germany on September 9, 1939'' is a pretty audacious assertion that I've certainly never heard before, and I've done a fair amount of work on this encyclopaedia that relates to the evolution of Canada's independence. < - > It's true that Canada phased out it's use gradually, but the independent declaration of war is generally accepted as the Constitutional precedent that established Canada's functional independence to the British Monarch. That is confirmed by Heard's 1990 quotation of Scott above. It also explains WHY the Canadian government stopped referring to Canada as a Dominion; it was a deliberate and significant act by the Canadian government to assert its independence from the British Monarch. It was a way of consolidating Canada's first act of total independence in its foreign affairs. That's not me saying it; it's the constitutional scholars quoted above. Again, almost all constitutional scholars agree with Scott's opinion.
The Gaza population density is 4118/km2 which is ranked the 2nd densest urban area in the world. < - > My data seem to disagree with that - see, for example, here, page 77 - Gaza is ranked 36th, and that's counting the Gaza city area, not the entire strip, yielding a much higher density of 16,450/km2.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose, belatedly, per my many comments on this topic per WP:WEIGHT and this section of WP:FRINGE.
Women hate women more than they hate men!! < - > @MogulWoman @yeankhar I don't agree , women always have issues among one another but I have seen women stand up for one another several times .
Oppose inclusion per WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.
That's fine those future voters will not reelect you and outlive you too can't wait to see what the history textbooks our generation writes will have to say about people like you https://t.co/96wQvE1cNA  *cough cough its called the first amendment. < - > @davidhogg111 While I disagree with many of your arguments I will always support peaceful protest for your beliefs and people who try to punish those who do so are behaving in an Un-American way.
The pertinence of the quotation is that centrifugal force can injure you, and mathematical shuffling of terms from one side of an equation to the other hardly captures the reality. < - > No, that's completely wrong.
That was really obnoxious! < - > I thoroughly enjoyed it, less for the whinging and more for the astute observations of Hollywood culture.
As I said in the message to which you are responding, a frame is NOT a coordinate system, it is an equivalence class of mutually stationary coordinate systems. < - > No. You said: A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. It means you're talking about a different situation than scoped by this article.- (
Open letter to Shaun Abrahams: Do not prosecute Jacob Zuma https://t.co/bhnXQ65Vxk https://t.co/r0ubZfxAJr < - > @TimesLIVE I don't agree. People are prosecuted daily for corruption and fraud. Why should he receive privileged status not to be prosecuted. 700 plus cases no way.
But when we are trying to present a picture of waterboarding as a general practice it does not make sense to have more than half of the article be examples from the last five years about the US military. < - > It's inevitable that most of this article is going to be about the recent use of waterboarding by the U.S.
We are "united in our condemnation of Russia's actions" - Scotland's first minister @NicolaSturgeon says she supports PM's initial actions over poisoning of former spy in Salisbury    https://t.co/VyS3tSGjuI https://t.co/giSOLzFdb7 < - > @BBCNews @NicolaSturgeon @NicolaSturgeon is doing the right thing in her position and supporting defence of the country whilst putting party politics aside for this important issue. I disagree with pretty much everything she says, but she deserves respect for her professionalism with this.
And Zionist entity and Zionist regime do NOT have different meaning at all. < - > I found ''Zionist Regime'' and other descriptions instead.
What this means is that we should say, ''Legal scholars, international organizations, {drop in everybody else} state that waterboarding is torture. < - > Strongly oppose.
Colin, you did not quite have the authority to make a wholesale deletion, even though in general I agree with the action. The course should have been for you to ask that I delete them or notify me of it before deleting them.-- < - > Actually, per WP:NOTAFORUM, it is common to remove off-topic rants, but if Dbrodreck can solve the issue via another method, I'm not opposed.
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy (and it is not clear to me that it does), I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal, although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church, and much more encyclopedia-worthy, to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum. < - > Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy.
Now name me ONE person in Turkey who acknowledges Armenian Genocide and has not been persecuted. < - > Plus in the cases that are related to AG the defendants are not charged of ''acknowledging'', but the prosecutors usually pick some parts from their statements, that sound offensive out of its context.
Oppose I haven't yet seen a convincing reason not to include Carlson's research on the page, and simply because it is included is absolutely not justification to reflect jumbled criticisms from fringe sources. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
I think this is notable and the opening statement that Obama is our first black president in the Obama Wiki article should make mention of this, because of its historical significance. < - > So no.
What. We always have these sunsets lol. https://t.co/TInQfiZ85Z < - > @AngelaKorras agree to disagree
The credentialism being exhibited here is amusing, but irrelevant: a psychology professor pretending that the orientation of the Earth, sun, moon, planets and celestial sphere has any impact on human traits, interactions, or one-off events beyond that those that can be attributed to calendrical variation (yes, it is colder in the Northern Hemisphere in the month of December than it is in the month of June so your mother was more likely to be wearing more clothes when she gave birth to you in December than your friend's mother who gave birth in June) is not a reliable source for a very straightforward reason: the psychology professor is incorrect where the claims can be compared to evidence and otherwise is not even wrong. < - > No such claim is being made by any of the three psychology professors. Please show that you have read the thread over the past month, before commenting.
I'm the dreaded peer reviewer. < - > Karanacs, surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven't previously been involved in editing an article?
I hate trump supporters ahahahhahaha https://t.co/wFG9uCHwsj < - > @AmSwizzyBeatts Trump is a disaster and must be stopped. One way of doing this is learning to talk with people we disagree with. Check out this documentary about millions of Americans like you struggling to maintain hope: https://t.co/po0kSbeOho ^EM
One of the higher ups at the company responsible for digital media distribution under Johnny's committed suicide. I'll look for sources and information and translate them later on. < - > The company is in charge of Johnny's web as far as I know. I will look more into it. I've only seen Bunshun report on if so far and I don't exactly trust them or agree with their stance in many things so I want to find more sources before spreading the information.
Um, Unomi, Conservapedia is not a reliable source. < - > I am not claiming that Conservapedia is a reliable source, I am claiming that they have sources that seem to support their statements.
Read my above reply: i'd be satisfied with very little. < - > I for one, vote NAY to the ''detailed depiction proposal.''
Old news: desperate "influencers" buy followers and likes. New news: desperate musicians buy spots on playlists. https://t.co/3RNGM0vg7y < - > @kevin2kelly Gotta disagree with you on this one. As a musician using these services I can say I'm delighted, hopeful and optimistic about this new tier of promotion. 'Desperate musicians buy spots on playlists' is an unhelpful oversimplification.
Is there a possibility that a two-headed definition might be able to reach consensus? < - > I would have low enthusiasm for a lead sentence that talks about the subject being ''difficult to define''.
I'll restore the previous martyrdom image and hide the other image for now - there's no room for it further down, but it's a good image and would be okay at the beginning if there were actually a paragraph or two of introductory text for the culture section.Richard, this looks good. < - > Bleh, then we don't need a picture in the Martyrdom section.
Weird coincidence that the only non-Fox shows that have invited me on haven't been live. < - > @KyleKashuv That's not really weird at all Kyle. It's how this has worked since forever. When interviewing someone they don't agree with, they reserve the power to edit out remarks that destroy their narrative. Agree to do it, with the caveat that you make your own recording as well.
Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.-- < - > Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa were independent back in 1939, nobody denies they were allies of Britain from the very beginning of the war.
So if the name of the article were to change to Britain and Ireland, you would support the change? Or at least not oppose it? < - > No - I was only correcting myself. Worldwide, ''British Isles'' (or equivalents) is the prevailing term.
For it to be a conspiracy there has to be a guiding force, a cabal behind the whole thing. < - > but it's coordinated efforts to protect child predators.
It's my understanding, however, that you do not agree that there are two usages, but in fact only this secondary usage I call the ''coordinate'' usage. < - > Your understanding is wrong, as I've explained over and over and over.
We now need to discuss how to change the answer to question 1 to make sure it is noted that Obama was factually wrong when he stated in his book that he went to a ''Muslim school''.-- < - > I don't know if it needs to be changed, the links provided(in the FAQ) go into detail with explanations about it.
Astrological signs are so stupid and pointless < - > @oliviaarp i disagree, fuck aries w a passion
Fabulous made all the better by the choice of the last word! https://t.co/aoSn0d3Uqr < - > @JRubinBlogger @realDonaldTrump made the right decision by firing Tillerson. It was the way he fired Tillerson that I disagree with, because it was ruthless, tacky, unprofessional, cowardly. Tillerson called #Trump a "F"en moron last year. Tillerson got that one right!
McCabe is scheduled to retire on Sunday. This smacks of a petty, cruel effort to deny him his pension after 21 years of service to his country. https://t.co/4omLShxFIf < - > @Susan_Hennessey This just shows Trump is in no way presidential. He's just a kindergarden bully.   It will only take time for him to snap and walk into that kindergarden with an AR-15, shooting all the kids that don't agree with him.  The guy is a total lunatic.
To keep the momentum going on #nationalwalkoutday I've partnered with @cottonbureau to spread the message that #KidsArentKevlar and we need to reform gun laws. All proceeds will go to @Everytown. Please support! https://t.co/fZcuEWDWD4 < - > @Travon @goldengateblond @cottonbureau @Everytown Not that I disagree, but I feel obliged to mention Kevlar alone won't stop a typical AR-15 round (.223/5.56mm), except maybe ricochet fragments, etc.   But of course kids aren't steel, titanium, or ceramic armor, either.
in this case it obviously important and add understanding for reader who click link to see what ``Zionist regime`` refer to``. < - > I give up on anti-semitic link, not big deal.
No. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.
Sir, thoda kaam kar liye hote to ye minority majority wala bahana nahi dena padta. https://t.co/NMZLRTsYX7 < - > @bhak_sala I would disagree here (normally i find ur tweets sensible). Whatever bjp does, 99% minorities will not vote for bjp. Kaam:dhaam has no value for them
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > It's the largest oil spill in U.S. history, that's not minor.
WP:EL clearly and specifically forbids driving traffic to social networking sites, forums and mailing list, which seems to be the primary function of LAShTAL.com. < - > This is a wholly unreasonable attempt to delte a link that the user presumably fears might be considered ''pro''-Crowley.
No https://t.co/r4ZHsHZNKH < - > @bertkreischer Couldn't disagree more. If we could stand that length of time in a car we'd totally do it!
That's not the only NPOV issue either. < - > I suggest keeping the present form because it really is NPOV.
Wikt:practical: ''Being likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation; able to be put to use.'' I cannot fathom how Astronomy fits that definition, or will fit that definition until humanity gains an advantage from it aside from the theoretical (theory being the antonym). < - > But, the finiteness of the speed of light is indeed ''likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation'', namely to the creation of theories about stellar and galactic evolution.
What points? < - > I suppose your disregard for 'walls of text' led you to overlook them.
By the way, the forked article about ''planar'' motion is, I believe, very mis-named, because there is no need for any restriction to planar motion. < - > The article centrifugal force (planar motion) does treat planar motion, and the math on that page is restricted to that case.
I'm tired of saying exactly that, the problem is with a handful of editors who refuse to accept that that is what is meant by a neutral point of view and continually misrepresent the policy as 'no point of view'. < - > I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia.
Over-the-air still generates the overwhelming majority of sports TV audience. Daytona 500 had just 51K viewers per minute on FSGO (streaming) and 9.3M on TV. https://t.co/0iWmXQHd6h < - > @paulsen_smw I don't disagree with you, but if you look at the amount of streaming compared to 5 years ago, it is growing and will continue to.
The @bankofengland @PhilipHammondUK and the banks have learnt NOTHING since the last financial crisis.   https://t.co/WYKL6X0iBK < - > @SOLZ_ZYN @bankofengland @PhilipHammondUK I disagree....they've learnt that they can do what they like and the general population will not protest.  They've learned they can personally profit from "help" schemes and money printing.  They have learnt plenty. It's the people who have not learned
Davidson would need Steph Curry right now to beat Kentucky so stop with that pick ...they dont even belong a 12 seed < - > @fatbaldguyracin I disagree. Kentucky is so young. Davidson is such a crazy hard team to prep and play against.
Ranting tak salah.. tapi kalau kau rasa orang sekeliling kau tak selesa.. kau tulis je kat notepad dan simpan untuk bacaan kau kemudian hari. < - > Yes sometimes writing down things that you disagree  Really helps you to release your anger but be cautious of what you write amongst your viewer
All looks correct. < - > No, if you look towards the bottom of the page (in the succession navigation box), where predecessors and successors for any awards, offices, etc one has held or received, you will clearly see that Carol Moseley Braun is his ''predecessor'' and Alexi Gianoulias as his ''successor''.
It's ''pray against it, search your soul for what you have done and how to change, and take steps to rectify the wrongs and stop doing evil in order to keep the Devil at bay.''  Catholic doctrine doesn't allow ''the Devil'' as a ''get out of responsibility free'' card. < - > It's possible when the chief exorcist says ''the Devil lodges in the Vatican'' he means that, literally, the Devil is possessing members of the Church.
In the past 11 seasons, Josh McGown has 10 wins and 38 losses.   He'll be on a roster next year making $10 million. That's white privilege.  Colin Kaepernick being effectively banned from the NFL has NOTHING to do with football.   Nothing at all.   https://t.co/6OqH7i3xql < - > @ShaunKing Don't disagree with the one sentence in your tweet re: Kaepernick. Side note: if you're going to choose to rip on someone, at least have the decency to get their name right.
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article.
but I'm not a PoT fan. < - > Thankies :D It's actually not a PoT fanfic XD;; Crossroads :] But no one knows that fandom so I don't expect you to know it either ^^;; I'm so happy though cause I really didn't think I'd win ^^;;
The initial statement should read along the lines of 'Atheism is a belief in the non-existence of deities etc' - not a 'non-belief' as it states. < - > No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists.
What you have done is stated a opinion that is worthless to the betterment of the article. < - > I've been stating my case - and others have to - throughout this talk page and the talk page archives.
How about: ''A number of church teachings, such as those labeling abortion, contraception, homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil, are a frequent source of controversy today. < - > That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion, contraception and euthanasia though, which I feel is important to point out if we're going to directly address those issues.
These tags will be there forever, because there is absolutely no possible method to reach agreement with you. < - > I can't speak for others who have tried to place the NPOV tag and had it summarily removed, but my intent in placing the tag was simply to indicate that the NPOV of the article is disputed (which is a simple statement of fact, because I for one dispute it), and readers should consult the Discussion page for details of the dispute.
Do I look like a Russian Troll. Come on Liberals, just admit @HillaryClinton lost. https://t.co/TYBDPPztiz < - > @I_AmAmerica @HillaryClinton I've been accused of being one also, just because I disagree with them n point out the error of their ways. Lol
There are Reliable Sources the world over who dissent on this topic, therefore, it is NOT unanimous. < - > Basically, the existence of reliable sources does not necessarily mean that the assertions themselves are reliable.
Only because $BTC throws its little hissy fit the entire revolutionary crypto market has to suffer... This has to change... Bitcoin can not be the arbiter of the markets. Exchanges must create more pairings... < - > @CRYPTOCURRENC It works the other way too ;) bitcoin goes to the moon, profits will flow to alts and they'll moon too. I disagree we're in a bear market. We're going so much higher.
Man I hate moshpits they're dangerous as shit and when you just wanna go to a concert of your fave and be close to the stage and like uhhh not die, you can't??? Cause people run around and push you which is fucking useless and when you try talking about it people get bitchy um ok < - > Also this is just my opinion and im overprotective so if you disagree with me thats fine but uhh i dont really care cause its not gonna change my opinion
Actually, it is not describing the Creed (it is the Creed). < - > Descibe the creed in terms of its importance to the faith.
Might be best to find an uninvolved admin to summarize the RFC for us. < - > We already have that. Are you going to keep asking uninvolved admins until you get a comment that you can in someway interpret in favor of your POV?
OH MY https://t.co/Dng9RRoUmy < - > @PrideOfDetroit This Is one of the few moves that I disagree 100% on with BQ. Why do you think he released him?
Mayorkas first said he was unaware of discussions to use these kinds of tools on a categorical basis, then later clarified that officials had talked about expanding the use of those powers.'' Both statements support the fact that the administration has discussed using this power < - > No substance to it at all.
lol........really??.......you serious??.........you're going to take that position??........''definition'' or not.........(Geneva Conventions were created by Politicians)......you're going to justify dropping bombs on city centers and in the middle of civilian populations by saying they're ''military targets''???....this position may be accepted by international POLITICS........NOT the average person............to find the references for that.........ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK........anyways........I know this section is about defining ''terrorist tactics''........you obviously would like to use ''international political definitions'' when it suits your position (as you just stated) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted (as stated above with the U.N. < - > I have no objection to mentioning their election in the lead.
Not at all, the article is under attack on the basis of WP:IDONTLIKEIT, Popper may have rephrased what he said, yet in the 1982 edition of the same book, (3 years after his supposed retraction) the statement still stood. < - > The basis of this article is not at risk.
Mawson is far better than Dunk mate https://t.co/J46RpCg80g < - > @ManLikeMcBurnie Disagree
#BritishScienceAndEngineeringWeek needs to know that what @AECCUniversityC presents to its students can be far removed from science. See https://t.co/FrwH5qtq5y  and https://t.co/j6D1pe7TFD #SinghBCA https://t.co/C1pcLDbW7Z < - > @Blue_Wode @AECCUniversityC As a physicist conducting research @AECCUniversityC I would have respectfully have to disagree.  Indeed, your post only highlights how diverse is the topic spectrum is among invited speakers @AECCUniversityC, as is appropriate to university which promotes discussion and debate.
Obama has also taken full responsibility for it which attaches the whole incident to his ''presidential hip''. < - > It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly.
Betsy DeVos: Trump's Secretary of IGNORANCE as she readily proves whenever she's given a moment to speak. #DeVos melts down on #60Minutes but #Tillerson gets fired? #BetsyDeVos is an embarrassment to our nation. No amount of personal wealth negates that. https://t.co/dyJfgzWqGz < - > @NWPinPDX @MatthewWolfff @Cruellaisdevine @MamaRose2017 @debbiesideris @LunaLuvgood2017 @mcspocky @EzraBridger2018 @DearAuntCrabby @ArtistsPo @brycetache Pretty simple really, she talks the company line no matter what.  Tillerson, with all of his shortcomings (and there were MANY) had the audacity to disagree with Herr Orange.  Gone.  I suspect Nikki Haley may be next.
Some critics are calling this oil spill ''Obama's Katrina''. < - > Again, this is just more unreferenced guesswork that is essentially meaningless and doesn't improve the article.
Thus, Nielsen ''An agnostic, like an atheist, asserts either that he does not know that God exists--or, more typically, that he cannot know or have sound reasons for believing that God exists--but unlike the atheist he does not think that he is justified in saying that God does not exist or, stronger still, that God cannot exist.'' It seems rather tendentious to insist that Nielsen here means to be taken to be saying that atheists hold either that God does not exist or that God cannot exist. < - > How do you figure it is tendentious? It is exactly what he is stating in the starting paragraph, and repeats again later - the reason for pulling in agnosticism seems to be to better explain atheism.
not even https://t.co/eNsPnDFhs0 < - > @effychelly Lol you disagree ?
4 quarters basketball needs to stay!!!! That was wayyyyy better than two halves basketball. < - > @SBartle247 people disagree with the 4qtr bullshit, go watch nba with all the other scum
The current sentence says ''The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth, and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy'' - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space. < - > ''but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space.''No.
Anonymous commenting is turned ON (it always is, but okay). < - > Not anonymous.
It does not, however, treat general relativity and curvilinear coordinate systems. < - > We shouldn't confuse the introduction of general curvilinear coordinates with general relativity.
Dear Twatter CEOs, because you allow tRUMP and his mentally unstable worshippers to spew so much hate and violence and complete idiot act, I am cavelling my Twatter account so as to give him one less audience member. Fuck you. < - > @KatFtAV Donald Trump is a failure and must be stopped. Part of doing this is learning to talk to those we disagree with. American Times is a documentary that offers some hope in these dark times.: https://t.co/L6wN2UIbdE ^EM
I plead innocent of deleting or ignoring the discussion by Stommel. < - > Your plea of innocence is false.
My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > Keep the single image, with a note as suggested, linking to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom article.
But once we allow ''characterizations'' in this article, it ceases to be black-and-white, but rather a range of gray. < - > That is a very careless argument.
Perhaps you could do us the courtesy of specifying where WP:CITE contradicts Template:Cite book, OR says anything about not having accessdates. < - > Besides the fact that it's not listed under ''Book'', you'll notice it says that access dates are used instead of publication dates for web-only sources that lack the latter - books clearly do have publication dates. You'll also notice that the page provides examples of GBooks-inclusive citation formats, none of which include access dates. In addition to WP:CITE, you can also look at the standards applied at FAC - since this article is an FA, it must meet those standards.
Is Wikipedia even going to mention it, or at least that he went down to the Gulf to check on the spill's cleanup process? < - > Traveling to the scene of a disaster by itself isn't that remarkable.
It was agreed Terrorism is aganist Wihipedia rules. < - > ''It was agreed...'' = Using the passive tense to describe a decision without naming who or when is classic propaganda-speak.
Could we consider using WP:SS to reduce the undue weight given to current US practices (which are only one example of many) once this is unprotected? < - > I don't see how WP:SS would help.

It is a complicated topic. Anyone who admits how complex it is, will, I think, ind out current introduction pretty reasonable and not overly long. < - > It's not that complicated. The definition is rather simple: an economic system where production is primarily directed by the owners of capital. That's all there is to it. The rest follows from there.
There are still unresolved POV issues, issues with the writing and non-encyclopedic tone, reference and sourcing issues, and notable controversies glossed over and/or ignored.-- < - > I think it is tightly POV in reference to the Catholic Church and is not a 360 degree view of the Church.

I'm fine with the walkout. And it's fine if these kids are pro-gun control. They're just kids and they're trying to figure out the issues. My problem is that the schools would never tolerate a conservative demonstration in this vein. < - > @MattWalshBlog with respect, disagree with assessment. the left is trying to re-create the 60's radicals by pushing these kids to believe all this is fine. Today walkouts demanding changes tomorrow riots to force change.
There are no Wikipedia policies that would require elimination of either of these sources I have used to create the Beliefs section. < - > Maybe not, but it may not be enough to help the article pass FAC.
Don't date someone until you have discussed ....social issues together...culture...beliefs...their political views...the way they look at life when it comes to these topics...some of our crushes' minds are really shallow...goodness gracious!!!! Disappointing https://t.co/pCaopkUcRP < - > @GodfreyTauya Bruh! The worst are the people who actually have NO opinion or refuse to share opinions on such matters...it's confusing, you can't even figure them out.

You get exactly those same 3 forces (centrifugal, euler, coriolis) in polar coordinates which is applied to a non inertial frame in addition to the 'centrifugal force' that appears relative to the coordinate axes. They'll resolve differently in the coordinate system, but they'll still point in exactly the same directions and be of the same intensity.- ( < - > It simply makes a statement of fact, that when certain acceleration terms based on a rotating reference frame about a fixed axis are brought over and treated as forces, they are called centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler forces.

There was no ambiguity post-1931. The Statute of Westminster was absolutely clear: No act of the British parliament would have effect in Canada unless the Canadian government gave its consent to such. < - > It remained unclear whether the Canadian Parliament could advise the King on matters of War (i.e. whether Canada could declare independently of Britain). That's not my opinion, but the consensus among Canadian historians: ''Even though each of the Dominions was asserting and practising the right to conduct independent (though co-operative) foreign policies by the late 1930s, one crucial Imperial tie remained to be severed. Right up until the outbreak of the Second World War, it was not certain that the Dominions could take any independent stance on the declaration of war or neutrality. In this one vital aspect the unity of the British Empire lingered on, and it was based for the most part on the doctrine of the indivisible Imperial Crown; it was felt that anything less than the unity of the Empire would mean that the King could be advised to declare war on himself with respect to another of his territories. It was not at all certain that Britain had lost its unique right to advise the King on matters of war and peace for the whole Empire.''[4] That's a very important ambiguity and why Canada's independent declaration of war in 1939 represents another step in the long process to independence.
Certainly Unomi has not posted any, including the Sociology journal article, which merely talks about what happens to people's attitudes as they get older, and not how best to define those attitudes. < - > The sociological article is quite clear in establishing a usage that is the same as the other sources I have posted above, namely ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'', feel free to offer sources that you feel support your claim that there is not a consensus established about this by quality sources.
What matters is what the consensus position on the what the word means, if that consensus definition and that which you argue is preferred by atheists is one and the same then there is no issue. < - > If ''the'' ''consensus definition'' does not include the actual position of those who it purports to describe, then it's a worthless false consensus.
Regrettably I suspect you are correct.  All credit to @TRobinsonNewEra for making the attempt.

Here's an example of the kind of introduction that I think would be appropriate, accurate, and NPOV for the current article. < - > So I can't get behind this, it's implying things that are actually wrong; or more accurately, it's a bad definition of what the article is about, because it's overly narrow (see Wikipedia:Not_a_dictionary#Good_definitions- (

I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia. < - > It wouldn't be 'adopting a very strict version of neutrality', it would be adopting an incorrect misinterpretation of the policy, one that is specifically outlined as incorrect in the policy.
The snapshot of the arguments has been presented by the proposer of the RfC in a simplified and misleading way to the extent that the well was poisoned. This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different. The editors who have commented in opposition did so with appeals to policy, namely DUE, FRINGE, NPOV, etc, and nothing about the new wording that's been added would seem to change that because the content itself is what violates policy, not just how the introduction to the content in the RfC was worded.

I was simply surprised that it's integrated into a section about her music and that there is not a Personal life section in this article where it can go. < - > Another note, the charities section should also be intergrated into the Biography instead of being separated.
I'm not sure how ''prominent'' it should be, but the lead should certainly reflect the new data. < - > The two aren't really comparable, though, are they?
The existence of such expressed opinions suffices for inclusion in this list, and therefore inclusion does not necessarily indicate that any given entry is in fact pseudoscience.' If you wish to add a qualifier or cogent note on the entry please do so. < - > The source you've added doesn't support your above assertion, and as pointed out above, your reasoning is unpersuasive.
I hold the position that personal lives are trivial within the scope of an individuals career, purely for the reason their personal life is obviously not their life's work. < - > And I maintain that Personal life sections are not trivial within the scope of an individual's career and that Personal life sections are not that different from Early life sections.
And Zionist entity and Zionist regime do NOT have different meaning at all. < - > I found ``Zionist Regime`` and other descriptions instead.

There are very good reputable sources that take the 'long view' of the child abuse scandal on the Church. < - > I have already scoured available information on the topic to come to the current paragraph.
I'm going to go ahead and pre-emp your objections to whatever source is going to be presented by noting that although CNN, the Huffington Post and MSNBC are typically seen as liberal and Fox News and WSJ are typically seen as conservative none of these groups identify with a political ideology and they all count as independent sources as far as RS guidelines are concerned. < - > I'd personally be wary about calling Fox a RS after Sherrodgate.
It's a disservice to the type of informaiton Wikipedia is trying to provide.I might as well address this point now: as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with. < - > I would love to see if there IS a picture that would be usable for the article, but...to be honest, I don't think the ''pictures of an abortion'' have a place here.
For this application of the mathematical construct, the coordinates are given physical interpretations in terms of space and time. < - > Again, you completely miss the point. In dynamics the coordinate systems are four-dimensional, including a time dimension. (Otherwise, there could no such thing as a ''rotating coordinate system''.) Also, please do try to bear in mind that you aren't arguing with me, you're arguing with Grunbaum, Earman, Friedman, Stommel, Beer, Johnston, etc. etc., in other words, all the reputable sources that present the view of this subject that you are trying to suppress. Wikipedia policy is to accurately represent all notable views on the subject in a proportionate way. The current article strictly excludes all but one POV. This is not in accordance with Wikipedia policy, and I'm trying to correct it. I've provided plenty of references from the most reputable sources to show the existence of a very notable view (actually several notable views) of this subject, and I am working to incorporate these, in a proportionate way, into the article. It seems to me that you have a strong feeling of ''ownership'' over this article, and you absolutely refuse to allow any view other than your own personal point of view to be represented. In the long run, I don't think you will be able to maintain the level of personal ownership of this article.
Zionist regime and Zionist entity are one and the same. < - > You are interpreting again where credible sources interpret it differently.

Actually wouldn't calling it ''Standard English'' instead of ''British English'' not be a better and mroe neutral idea? < - > For some reason recent comments are not showing up for me except in edit or revision history mode...Anyway, I doubt our American, Canadian or Australian readers would agree to the use of ''Standard English'' as a more appropriate term for ''British English'', as they would surely regard their own variety of English as ''standard''.
Within that context, general curvilinear coordinates are the most comprehensive, and when the discussion is framed in those terms, the entire subject becomes unified, and one sees that what had seemed to be distinct concepts are really just different ways of looking at exactly the same thing. < - > I'd agree that ''just the same thing'' can be described in various coordinate systems. However, the fictitious forces and the classification of the various contributions as ''centrifugal'', ''Coriolis'', or ''Euler'' depends strongly upon the observer's state of motion (e.g. are they rotating? and about what axis, oriented how?) and not upon their selection of coordinates (Cartesian, arc-length, etc.) to describe what they see.

Also, the recent audit found almost all of the diocese in compliance - there was one or two that did not meet some requirement so they failed - they were in fact doing most of the things required but not all. < - > And, a recent report that has audited some US dioceses has found non-compliance of their own prevention abuse guidelines.
I think the people who complain about "politics" in "kids programming" are actually angry that their kids are being informed and they don't get to put their slant on it first. < - > Because, let's face it, whenever that complaint is made, it's involving a compassionate take on a topic they disagree with: kids with parents in jail (Sesame Street), homosexuality, gun control, schoolkids not wanting to be shot, etc...
But this article should be perhaps changed to 'Armenian Genocide Theory' or 'Armenian Genocide Claims' in order to neutralize the article. < - > Sorry to say, but your weasel tactics to justify the mass slaughter of a million armenians are a bit far fetched.

Of course, this should be done for all of those countries, but we have to start somewhere. < - > The FACT is, people have been trying to impose this made-up category on this article page for years, when in FACT, they should have been removing it from other country article pages, because it has no basis among reliable external sources.
I hope Levine can explain what he was trying to say because to me Levine seemed to be saying that authorities on pseudoscience are pseudoscientific themselves.Regarding, ''Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science. < - > I definitely wasn't calling any sources ''pseudoscientific''.
i was always terrified of needing someone, it was simpler to feign my strength along with all my other lies but the needing came, irreversible, irrefutable and it swept everything away, the deceptions and my strength. < - > you are not as dependant as you think you are.
It means that ''God exists'' makes no meaningful claim & can be neither true nor false. It also means that ''God does not exist'' makes no meaningful claim & can be neither true nor false. It means that ''I am justified in saying, 'God does not exist''' makes no meaningful claim & can be neither true nor false -- except for the anthropomorphic God. It means that ''no adequate nonanthropomorphic extralinguistic referent for the word 'God'' has been obtained'' does make a meaningful claim and CAN be either true or false. < - > Close - but ''God exists'' is not what is being sought a referent for, God is, and reference failure isn't ''can be neither true or false'', that is the property that it has for not referring to anything.
Sorry JimWae, but it is difficult to express just how extraordinary a claim that is without seeming insulting. < - > I am quoting parameters given in the article itself. Nobody has agreed that the response you got from someone at EB resolves anything in your favour--
I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church. < - > Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight.

Listen, you can defend torture, or you can defend the Constitution. Not both. The 8th Amendment explicitly forbids torture with all forms of cruel and unusual punishment. To defend torture is to attack the Constitution. < - > @Snowden I don't agree. If someone kidnaps a child, you only have a very limited time to recover them. If you capture one of the kidnappers, you need to do whatever you can to recover the child. Afterwards, give them the death penalty.
The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source. < - > The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context.

I think that B qualifies as a ''Practical effect'' of A, or even better as a ''Practical consequence'', or, if you like, as a ''Useful consequence'', or as a ''Useful effect'', or as a ''Useful application''. < - > I guess this is what happens when you come to a page frequented by science geeks (not an insult: I'm one too). The ability to measure a distant star is considered ''practical'' on the same level as everyday usage of a computer or a GPS.

I restored the source and changed the wording to (hopefully) better reflect what it is actually saying. < - > I completely agree with your point that the citation does not point to a ''review'' of Canada's ''economic weight in space science...'' BUT IMO the present sentence can readily be construed as such. In brief, the sentence misinforms by giving a tabular ratio undue weight. The cited source does not report a ratio that pertains directly to ''academic institutions'' (sic, this is what WP presently is saying) (this is not the Times Higher Education World University Rankings) but purports to be a tabular ranking of an 'impact factor' (that is being floated by the source as a conceptual surrogate for something like ''average publication quality'') of academic papers in space science ''from'' (sic, the source) Canada. I readily concede that using the term ''institution'' is sort of logical, since it is quite likely (but not confirmed for us) that this was the descriptor in the database, but from a WP point of view, ''institution'' isn't what the source says, and while we are probably right, we don't know (at least not from this source as written). The source uses a vague term, ''from'' and that's what we can cite (if the source in all it's considered aspects is adjudicated as providing material of encyclopedic character, and not of undue weight.) IMO we could arrive at... '' In 2009, Thomson Reuters collated data in a proprietary index of academic papers from 1999 to 2009; those from Canada ranked third in impact... ...'' The cited source does not itself purport to look at ''research'' papers only (sic, this is what WP presently is saying, and by saying it, WP implies that was all that was indexed, and that's not what the source says), but at a composite of ''...only journal articles (original research reports and review articles) indexed by Thomson Reuters...'' So correcting that point, and simplifying a little (by losing excessive words), and using the source itself, we get something like, '' In 2009, Thomson Reuters, collating data from 1999 to 2009, ranked Canada as having the third highest national average of citations per academic space science paper...'' or simpler, we have ''Canada has the third highest number of citations per academic space science paper...'''' ... That's close to what you have, BUT... IMO, after thinking carefully, the two principal problems with the citation and the wikipedia sentence it supports are 1. an inappropriate source (''unreliable'' in wiki-speak) that is 2. given undue weight.

Surely you are aware that this is just tertile being expressed in more user-friendly way (colours and words 'high','medium','low'). Are you saying that we cannot even divide by three because it is considered original research and not simple logical deduction? < - > Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Why not divide by two, or four, or five, or six, or eight?
Besides your well-founded objections, the proposed intro is unclear, both as to terminology and as to what is meant by the terms it defines. < - > Lacking any substantive objections, I think we should make this change.
The sociological article is quite clear in establishing a usage that is the same as the other sources I have posted above, namely ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.'', feel free to offer sources that you feel support your claim that there is not a consensus established about this by quality sources. < - > There are lots of counterexamples, and the text of the current article cites some of them. This has been repeatedly discussed over the years, we surely don't need a year zero approach. There is indeed a usage that interprets atheism as an index of certainty or dogmatism, an interpretation that is challenged by the work of many atheists who do not claim certainty. The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed.
Harald: Sorry for the confusion caused here. < - > I don't think the above comment address the point that Harald raised.
If ''the'' ''consensus definition'' does not include the actual position of those who it purports to describe, then it's a worthless false consensus. < - > It doesn't purport to describe people who call themselves atheists, it describes people who are atheists. Your argument is like saying that if a group of ~100 IQ people go around calling themselves geniuses that we should rush to embrace a definition of genius == 100 IQ.

While no one, except mostly reality show stars, become famous/notable for their personal lives, I do not believe that it's trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia. < - > I hold the position that personal lives are trivial within the scope of an individuals career, purely for the reason their personal life is obviously not their life's work.

All reputable sources on dynamics recognize that time is one of the coordinates of the coordinate system. Are we really down to the level of arguing about whether time is a coordinate? An endless number of reputable references can be supplied to substantiate the fact that time is a coordinate in the science of dynamics, and that inertial coordinate systems include a time coordinate. The comments of Brews ohare are simply incorrect. Quoting from a book describing purely spatial coordinates does not contradict the fact that dynamics is carried out in coordinate systems that include a time coordinate. Perhaps we should ask for this point to be reviewed by a wider audience of scientifically literate editors, to see what they thing? < - > I would add that the mathematical idea of coordinate system is not restricted in any way to three dimensions nor to the interpretation of what the coordinates may mean in any particular application.
We need to be able to talk about capitalism without assuming it can only exist with ''free markets''. Take Braudel, who analyzed the history of capitalism without restricting himself to only studying where markets were ''free'', which would basically eliminate the entire discipline. < - > There is no such things as a capitalist system without free markets. A free market is one where the government is not dictating how much is produced and the price to charge.
I link to Zionist regime, which is very clear for anyone to see in edit history, unlike what you say which is completely untrue. < - > I couldn`t find it.
Getting disowned for tweets I liked and it's not even totally undeserved, RIP < - > @isawrobertsmith Agreed with her points overall, disagree with what needs to be done tho
If we're going to name categories, those names and categories must be based on external sources that meet our verifiability standards. We're not allowed to create category divisions ourselves, understand? < - > However, I do not see why 'highest third', 'lowest quarter' etc. would not be accepted as the verifiability policy states that 'drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research'.
there was no zionist entity prior to the zionist regime and if the regime in israel will cease to be zionist then israel will cease to be a zionist entity. < - > I agree that there can be no Zionist entity without a Zionist regime but a Zionist regime can still exist quite happily if Israel ceases to be a Zionist entity.
Your last comment simply shows your POV, being a Hamas apologist. < - > And I am not a Hamas apologist.
We totally disagree with you ... They sold us well... We just have to broaden the perspective they sold that we are much more than Comedians https://t.co/hInkNLwsqk < - > @NGLPROJECT1 Sure, I respect your opinion sir. Everyone has got a right to agree or disagree with stated facts. Perhaps I should rephrase my comment so you can understand my point better. "[some] comedians &amp; actors have [unwittingly] misrepresented d good image of #Warri people as violent"
The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source. I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact. < - > The original sources, one of which was Kamen, actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence, (technically, released to the civil authority,) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out.
BDS is a fucking horribly broken anti-semitic nightmare and any candidate for office that goes on the BDS bandwagon is signing on to a really vicious form of anti-semitism that rejects self-determination entirely and FFS literally everyone wants a two-state solution to work < - > @taber I disagree with you, and I'm Jewish. "Literally everyone" does not want a two-state solution to work, and Jewish supporters of BDS understand this.
The imperialist right-wing of the Parliamentary Labour Party will never learn. They are bellicose, out of touch and demonstrate why we urgently need mandatory reselection. < - > @UmaarKazmi Yep, mandatory reselection of people because they disagree with you. That always ends well- and implicitly says something about your core personality!
About the discussion on KT talents - if I played only HL and not competitive I would go convection.  It's just too hard to complete vs other pros, but it's still a good talent if you can complete it most of the time. < - > @adrdhots Completely disagree. You go oom way to fast, means less damage / poke + a dead KT can't do any damage :P  since new globe changes you have this quest done so fast
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! < - > @realDonaldTrump Firing Andrew McCabe would just showhow unfair you are. In no way presidential. But just a kindergarden bully.   It will only take time for you to snap and walk into that kindergarden with an AR-15, shooting all the kids that don't agree with you.  You are a total lunatic!!
We are in the golden age of bigs in the NBA https://t.co/PPjrciYkrU < - > @maxkellerman Heavily disagree. 90's had Barkley, Malone, Robinson, Ewing, Hakeem, Shaq, Mourning, and Mutombo. Those guys essentially guaranteed their teams made the playoffs every year. The same isn't true of the "unicorns" today. Maybe one day the unicorns will be similar, but not yet.
Could we consider using WP:SS to reduce the undue weight given to current US practices (which are only one example of many) once this is unprotected? < - > I don't see how WP:SS would help.
The newly edited introduction for this article sounds too ambiguous and it severely lacks succinctness and conciseness. < - > Sorry, I disagree. I think in this particular case the ''ambiguity'' should be noted from the outset.
Just posted a GIF from SPIDER-MAN 2 and was reminded what a fantastic villain Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus is. Scary, sympathetic, and the mechanical arms are wonderfully similar to actual octopus arms in having "minds" of their own. < - > @osutein I sometimes disagree with your opinions on movies and books (though I don't usually say so unless I feel like I have a point to make; my opinion is no more valid than yours), but interestingly, I'm 100% with you here.
But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan, Letterman, Ferguson, or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now. < - > I dislike Conan and Leno, and I maintain Kimmel is nothing without Corrola.
This is a biography cover his entire life. < - > While I do agree the bulk of any mention should be included in Obama's presidency article, it's worth a mention here too.
because it always feels so performative https://t.co/v1rXZvfaze < - > @julianjamesss Ehh I disagree. Sometimes some take a while to gain the confidence to even send that dm
The goal is to make Wikipedia as good as possible and, more specifically, this article as good as possible. < - > It has become apparent that your account(s) and IP's are only being used for promoting links to lashtal.com and is considered WP:Spam.
Oppose: Any mention of the criticisms mentioned as none of the criticisms have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and all of the ''journals'' in which they were published are clearly fringe, they should not be used at all to challenge a real scientific study. WP:PARITY explicitly states that fringe journals are not to be considered reliable sources, and that only reliable sources are to be used. The criticisms are furthermore not noteworthy of inclusion in the article because they have not been discussed in reliable sources, and are not in any way part of genuine scientific discourse. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
The title was the only problem. < - > The title was not the only problem.
It is a really beautiful and special place and much loved by Transnistrians. < - > Mark, yours may well be the version of the story taught to Transnistrian kindergarteners.
Christine Talbot is such a milf < - > @ShannooonLP I can't disagree
I think this is notable and the opening statement that Obama is our first black president in the Obama Wiki article should make mention of this, because of its historical significance. < - > I think it would be WP:UNDUE to mention it on this article or go against the weight of reliable sources that say otherwise.
Let us be real...  To these ignorant children, these walkouts are just social events that get them out of school.  These are not profound political statements by deep-thinking young people.  The kids are being used as pawns.  #NationalWalkoutDay #walkout #WednesdayWisdom < - > @TheMarkPantano Gonna disagree with you. I have a junior and she organized her schools walkout. She worked with the principal. She and her peers are ready to take part in the political process. They are learning the issue and learning civics. Your lack of faith in them is misplaced.
No, it isn't clear and it isn't unambiguous. A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and the challenge to Wolf is to explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. Remember, the physics doesn't change for a choice of coordinate systems, nor does it change for a choice of a set of coordinate systems (i.e., a frame). Fictitious forces are fictitious. So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other? < - > You confuse the mathematical term ''coordinate system'' with the physical application of this mathematical construction in which a coordinate system is applied to describe physical events in a frame of reference. For this application of the mathematical construct, the coordinates are given physical interpretations in terms of space and time. For this application, a Cartesian coordinate system is not essential of course, and many other types of coordinate system are employed depending on how they simplify the problem. For example, an arc-length coordinate system might be used, or a polar coordinate system. I'm sure you know this - you're simply playing games here.
Our reviews of the literature over the years have demonstrated time and time again that atheism has no single simple definition. Your own posts of the usual texts (and how familiar they all are to some of us old hands by now) demonstrate this once again. There is no consensus in the literature (sociological or philosophical). < - > Relevant and interesting, yes - impacting how we present the consensus definition of atheism, no. Consensus doesn't mean that everyone has to agree, it simply means that the majority of quality sources do. Let me clear up what I meant above, I certainly don't mean that we should exclude RS material just because it was written by atheists, not at all - what I meant to address was the notion that just because someone calls themselves atheist that they somehow have the ability to redefine what it means.
I personally found Tim's explanations to you to be quite clear and correct. < - > It's not enough to be clear and correct. We agree it's a clear and correct meaning. But there's only one meaning allowed per article, and that's not the dominant one.
I don't have to do SHIT to my house --- it's YOUR children who are trespassing on my mom's property, not me. < - > You don't owe it to them or anything, but it is kind of shitty to have your lights on on Halloween when you aren't there / aren't planning to answer.
It's not the business of Wikipedia to prescribe ''correct'' usage; as a matter of fact the term ''British Isles'' is being used for Britain and Ireland. < - > @Mike, what makes you think that the readers of the article will read that far?
In between directing tons of Goldbergs episodes, @jaychandrasekha made a sequel to one of the best movies ever. Yes, I first hired Jay 'cause he was Thorny. But I told him so. He was very gracious and continues to answer all my @brokenlizard fanboy questions. Can't wait for this! https://t.co/fwLcIXa11i < - > @adamfgoldberg @jaychandrasekha @brokenlizard I disagree....clearly "Club Dread" was the best Broken Lizard movie.....(Kidding No One thinks that)  I think "Beerfest," may be a bit better than Super Troopers though.
It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly. < - > Well, the news media thinks it has something to do with him.
Capitalist mode of production may describe it from a marxist perspective, and may therefore be useful in marxist contexts, but that description is consequently either misleading or inaccurate when applied to the real world and to evidence-based economics. < - > The thing is only even fully understood as such (i.e. als ''das Kapital'') due to Marx.
Mahrez &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez.  United definitely missed a trick with that one. < - > @MixahFanimo @Munanizzy I disagree
Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability. < - > But to say that Personal life sections (which by the way, do not have to be titled Personal life, as noted with the Angelina Jolie article) should not or should rarely be included in Wikipedia is something that I do not agree with.
Here we go again.. Dimwit alert https://t.co/4jTG3BaLqF < - > @CaryLynnWolfe1 No fing way not in this day and so disagree no way no how
But there's only one meaning allowed per article, and that's not the dominant one. It would just simply be undue weight to include it here: WP:UNDUE. < - > No, what was clearly and correctly explained is that this is all just different ways of looking at the very same thing.
I'm using it in the classic sense. ''Regulation'' is the setting of production and pricing. Supply and demand is regulation. Quantities produces and prices set can be regulated by supply and demand or by the government. When they're regulated by the market, it's a free market. When they're regulated by the government, theyre called ''regulated markets.'' It has nothing to do with safety regulations and what not. < - > There are enough definitions by political economists and historians to make this a POV issue.
Appointing an actual pliers and tongs torturer to head up the CIA makes the U.S. look like Uganda under Idi Amin. < - > @JulianAssange #disagree with this assessment.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > I'm not so keen on: Suggested re-wording: Modern challenges faced by the church include the rise of secularism, and controversy over its prohibition of abortion, contraception and euthanasia.
As long as you're rewriting what monuments were built for, perhaps you'd like to revive the one about Latvia's freedom monument being built to thank Stalin for liberating the Baltic states. < - > This is Transnistria not Latvia.
Again, you seem to have already decided for yourself what you think atheism is. < - > ''you seem to have already decided for yourself what you think atheism is'' - I would say that my understanding of atheism seems wholly supported by the majority of sources presented, I would have to ask why it is that your understanding is different.
Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous, I'm still excited. < - > Next week's is probably going to be a disaster.
Boozy literally trying to stan for RC Fox and expecting people to feel sorry for kicking his fucking child molester ass out of the fandom. Give me a fucking break. RC Fox was out on bail.  I don't give a flying fuck about what he did to himself. < - > @VenusAsABun Can you say you truly knew him? What about his family? Friends? Etc. They mourn and yet here you are saying more or less good riddance....  EVEN if we don't agree on everything OR if someone did something illegal why wish death upon them?...You are NO better than those people you
what is so hard to understand about ''Believers think that, though God is a mystery, such a referent has been secured, though what it is remains a mystery. Atheists, by contrast, believe that it has not been, and indeed some of them believe that it cannot be, secured.'' == ''Believers think that there is something that is God, Atheists believe there is no such thing as God, and some believe there cannot be something that is God'' - This is like trying to explain evolution to ID'ers, seriously. < - > I'm not sure, but with your stated equivalence above concerning referents, you seem to end up equating A:''P does not believe x'' (because no referent was secured) with B:''P believes not x'' which is not true in general because although B implies A, A does not always imply B. It is incorrect then to conclude that all atheists under Nielson and Edwards' similar definitions are strong atheists, who nearly always assert ''God does not exist''.
Watched #TSK, terrible remake of a wonderful "Special 26". Had to rewatch "Special 26" immediately after to atone for my sins. Wish Suriya stopped making mass movies. < - > @Lakshanam_ i disagree..i liked #TSK because i didnt watch Special 26.. infact it was good towatch Suriya in a role not shouting at the top of his voice .. anyday a remake can never match to the original
Waterboarding is torture, the use of torture here is a descriptive term - it explains what it is, and vital for an inclusive description of what waterboarding is. < - > By showing who says waterboarding is torture, and who says it isn't, we can educate the savvy reader.
I will second that. < - > Unfortunately, the motion's ''first'' says he has departed.
Maybe these things are of interest to people but lets give the real and full story and not just the propaganda.The real stroy is that the tank is part of Glory Memorial Complex which is home to the graves of the brave ones killed by Moldovan soilders during the war for independence and where the eternal flame burns in their memory. < - > Dont lie This Tank was here long before 1992.
To #ComicsGate; I attempt to engage fans and creators with all different viewpoints. Sometimes this works, sometimes not. You can usually tell pretty quickly which way it is going to go. And yeah, that means sometimes you wander into ugliness and need to retreat. 1/8 < - > @ComicPerch This goes back to what Patch Zircher said about Twitter Police. There are people on social media obsessively checking to see which pros like or retweet people they disagree with.
one must cover their biscuit in gravy or a terrible secret will be released upon the earth < - > @DennysDiner thats where i disagree with you
I have also found the original author of the Current'article. < - > If you think atheists can't write reliably about atheism, please review this AfD to understand the failure of your logic.
Some critics are calling this oil spill ''Obama's Katrina''. < - > If you actually read that article, you will find the ''critics'' are non-notable residents of the nowhere-near-the-spill NYC area.
 < - > Adding chocolate chips wasn't the answer.
The difference between Pep and Mourinho is the former learnt from his mistakes last season,binned all the average players,replaced them with good ones while the latter still thinks Fellaini,Young,etc are good enough for utd. < - > @ScholesyLad While I don't disagree with this tweet,a few things to consider. Young isn't your first choice lb. Had Shaw not been injury prone,he would have started. Fellaini is needed for physical presence(reason you won EL). Had you sold both of them last summer,you would have abused Mou.
It should most likely be removed. < - > Copyright shouldn't be a problem here--it's quite clearly fair use.
I think that the article should have only a few sentences on the sex scandals - that is very recent, whereas the Church's efforts to set up missions have been quite longstanding (think of the Jesuits). < - > I understand.

Build yr freeports&amp;develop yr industrial base, fisheries, agriculture &amp;mining. Somalis in diaspora return&amp;invest. < - > @FarahMaalimM We disagree with them when it comes there behaviours against the Palestinians but you can never genarelise on your accusations people are people there are wrong doers and those who are innocent
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > Even if it's just a sentence or two under Domestic policy (subject to expansion in the future if he takes more direct action concerning the spill), it should at least be mentioned.
I thoroughly enjoyed it, less for the whinging and more for the astute observations of Hollywood culture. < - > Add the excessive bitterness, and I don't think she really accomplished more than making herself look like an ass.
This quote also comes from the institution that has done the most research into the matter and adds to the professionalism and credibility of the paragraph and article. < - > The refs were to the LDS and AAF websites, neither reliable secondary or independent sources.--
I do agree we neeed some photos but the use of photos of the tank and statue of Lenin are propaganda photos to try to associate PMR with communism. < - > That is not a photo of the Lenin statue, it's a photo of the Transnistrian parliament, which happens to have a statue of Lenin in front of it.
An Rfc is not sufficient because editors either ignore it when it is not favorable to their POV or they quickly take action as soon as they see one comment that could be in anyway interpreted in favor of their POV. < - > Might be best to find an uninvolved admin to summarize the RFC for us.
I think the point the author of that passage was trying to make is that Theravada is closer to the original Indian Buddhism than any other currently-practiced form of Buddhism is. < - > Theravada is in no sense ''closer to the original Indian Buddhism.'' They subscribe to a total deviation called Abhidharma. Secondly, I am reading a couple of recent history books on early Buddhism, and neither of them support your other statement that this is a ''well-established point of consensus among Western scholars.'' In fact quite the opposite, hence me starting this new section.

Labour MPs are being forced to draft their own EDM to condemn Russia because the Labour party leadership refuses to. A damning indictment of Jeremy Corbyn and Seumas Milne's Kremlin appeasement. These MPs deserve full credit &amp; praise for their actions.  https://t.co/rk2SLUqznn < - > @OzKaterji The French also prefer to abide by Democratic principle, and wait for proof of guilt.

Karanacs, surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven't previously been involved in editing an article? < - > I'm not one of the main editors even though I argue here a lot; my content contributions have been very very narrowly focused although I've done a lot of copyediting.
In Hungary, yes, but even Khanty and Mansi lie within Europe. < - > Khanty and Mansi are east of the Urals, so they are outside Europe.

I don't think Drake playing games with Ninja is some landmark moment. It's the most natural thing in the world for people to chill out playing games together, and the stream reflected that. If anything, it maybe serves as a strong counter to the internal gatekeeping in gaming. < - > @JeffGrubb Strong disagree with u. Huge moment in the culture. Folks no longer get to say gaming is for nerds. Neither does the club nor the news that covers drake songs. We on
Police say a teacher in California accidentally fired his gun in a classroom, injuring three students. https://t.co/cRM0cg2AXa < - > @AP @ABC7Jory And this is why I don't agree with arming our teachers. This may have been an accident but I've also have seen too many short tempered teachers.
That is not an example given of changing cite style. < - > Just because it's not given doesn't mean it's not an example - they can't very well include every possible example on that page, it'd be too long.
Other than being uninformative, it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article, by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV. < - > I disagree that they would not be informative.
I'm afraid to tell you that because it would come off as bitchy < - > it doesn't, and i appreciate that.
Atheism is an accepted form of belief in Hinduism, but is considered by some schools to be difficult to follow spiritually.[16] Your earlier version did not communicate the i talked about in the first reply. < - > That last sentence is getting into specifics & I have doubts that it even belongs in the lede anymore. Why mention Hinduism twice? Also, the text somewhat misleadingly suggests all schools of Hinduism are being represented. Also, it is disputed that atheism IS a ''form of belief''.
The point is that when you make a pipe, you don't call the link ''an oil rig'' and then link to a specific named rig. < - > Again, you're incorrect about how you're characterizing my edits, even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of (or a lack of focus on) the issue.

A valid comment unless you disagree with what Hawking believed on these issues.
I imagine that what has happened is that in the POV push and pull that plagues articles like this, the information has been shredded by people, much like yourself, who place advocacy before policy and damage content. < - > I am not the one who put in any garbage about occupying regime.
We need sources that explain how prevalent these views are and whether TP-supported politicians would act on this. < - > the tp is very clear about its desire to reduce spending across the board.
The point is that when you make a pipe, you don't call the link ''an oil rig'' and then link to a specific named rig. < - > The ''an oil rig'' wording was not created by my edit, it was created by yours.
Rihanna is in the spotlight, everything seen should be documented. < - > One other thing: In regards to your comment ''Rihanna is in the spotlight, everything seen should be documented.'' According to our own policies, no it shouldn't.

if it's night then shouldn't there be light coming from the inside of the buildings? < - > And I disagree with Sean that you need light coming from the windows, because if it is that late most lights would be turned off, and places like the bar would have really dingy lighting anyway.
No, you simply cannot delete them, as per the direct instruction of WP:LEAD. < - > The other passage from WP:LEAD that applies here: ''Well-publicized recent events affecting an article subject, whether controversial or not, should be kept in historical perspective.
We should not encourage kids to walkout of class.  As a parent, I have encouraged my children to stay in class, help others and learn both sides of every issue. @ < - > @AntonioSabatoJr I agree.I think we need 2 lead by example again &amp; learn 2 respect each other, our differences &amp; show our children to do the same. Education is important &amp; not just on a school level but also on a personal level; to not discriminate against those we don't know or understand.

Happy 85th birthday, Ruth Bader Ginsberg. May I live to see a Supreme Court made up of nine women... https://t.co/d7A9EYBPQK < - > @shannonrwatts Respectfully disagree. The Supreme Court should reflect the diversity of the country - in thought, race and gender.
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy (and it is not clear to me that it does), I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal, although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church, and much more encyclopedia-worthy, to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum. < - > Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy.
The article states that ''As of 2004, the vast majority of worldwide sex abuse cases have been in the United States'' - would you agree to that? < - > The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S.

''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > I was OK with the sentence, I took it to mean issues that have just been brought up in the Modern era as opposed to issues like heresy in the Roman empire age.
This is not an issue of undue weight, but if anything of systeic bias (and is this case, of systemic bias in the sources). < - > It's undue weight because in historical perspective this is just one example.

The difficulty with stating that the vast majority of cases have been in the U.S. is 'investigational bias'. < - > Wikipedia cannot compensate for the inequities of justice systems the world over. Too bad.

I dont think so.The West isnt islamophobic really.The right wing of the respective country is islamophobic, and these right wing groups are all close to Russia(except for Poland and Hungary ones) https://t.co/7jdsrE4jem < - > @ramenplayswith1 well, I disagree with that. There is intense and rising Islamophobia on both the left and the right. And western states (stupidly) see only the problem of jihadism in the Middle East. Sure it's a huge problem, but still a symptom rather than a cause. But I should do some work...
Kindly answer the argument that precisely the same charge, deliberate proximity to civilians during warfare, was made against Hezbollah by Israel and was rejected; how does that NOT very importantly relate to the deliberate proximity to civilians during warfare charge against Hamas? < - > I've already addressed that argument, several times: Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was ''rejected'' in the Hezbollah case (it was not), it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance (different time, different place, different organization) is also the case in this instance.
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state (it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government) so clearly they can not be interchangable. < - > My personal opinion is that at this time in history, there is no difference between the use of regime and entity when concerning zionism.
But the level of detail in a lot of the article can be reduced--the quotes are too extensive, we don't need to say much about KSM/Abu Zubaida other than that the U.S. < - > Akhilleus there is no reason to delete accurate sourced info, i still say the way to remove the US bias is to split the US section of to US waterboarding controversy and leave this article to cover the method, effects and history of waterboarding.
Some critics are calling this oil spill ''Obama's Katrina''. < - > The consensus in the news is that it isn't Obama's Katrina yet.
Why add many extra steps for people who want to check sources?-- < - > It's not an awful lot of extra steps to click on the ISBN and then click on ''Find this book on Amazon'' (or Google, or whatever).
We should combat all bias, not just give up and accept it.Am I to believe these subjects and points have not been summarized already? < - > I understand your frustration but there's nothing that can be done about it.
Note the image was only used thumbnail size in the article so if you were so offended why did you click so to see the larger version? < - > I don't think it's a valid point that it's small - would it be okay to have a thumbnail of a detailed photograph of two people enthusiastically copulating on the sexual intercourse article if you couldn't see their genitalia in the thumbnail?
Seriously, why is @bbcquestiontime giving a platform to RT, a mouthpiece for Putin? Russia has unleashed a nerve agent here in Britain &amp; 3 people, including a police officer, have been fighting for their lives. Hope other panellists walk out in disgust https://t.co/ndFtxGYRbm < - > @sarahwollaston @bbcquestiontime I disagree with you. Why shouldn't we hear what they've got to say? Do you think the people are too stupid to assess correctly what's being said? Personally I trust the people's collective judgement far more than the Establishment and politicians.
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > you're lucky we're awesome, but one of these days you're gonna get your face broken -.-
Placing a brief mention (as directly quoted in WP:LEAD of a clearly notable ( WP:LEAD again) controversy in the lead is not undue weight; dedicating 10% of the article (or 10% of the lead!) to the scandal (as one editor seemed to suggest) would be undue weight. < - > You also continue to be wrong and, as far as I can tell, are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position.
My response today to PM Theresa May's statement on the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. A firm and fair stance must be taken. https://t.co/P5p5Fnn4xR < - > @IanBlackfordMP Sorry Ian, don't agree. This whole affair is "suspect" in the extreme. Read up on the alternative views. Sad you and SNP think this is a sound position to take. Did you not think that your submission to UK Gov. is ONE reason we can look to MI5/6 instead?
This Telegraph article highlights the NPOV problem with this article. < - > I was just thinking that the article is really more POV in the anti-Catholic direction because of the serious lack of commentary on the multitude of charities and good works accomplished around the world.
Sister Of Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Arrested After Menacing Social Media Post https://t.co/Hi2jK7suer < - > @NPR While i don't agree with her racist nature. There was no direct threat in her comment. Proclaiming "i hope you get shot" is not the same as im going to shoot you.
Our factual article will actually help disperse misperceptions bred by the popular media if we can just make it NPOV and stick to the actual facts. < - > (Gosh did I really use the word ''fact'' over five times just now - that is why I need Xandar here - I cant speak English!)Good Granny again!
Anyone interested? < - > Sigh, no can do - my weekends are all booked up these days.
Maybe these things are of interest to people but lets give the real and full story and not just the propaganda.The real stroy is that the tank is part of Glory Memorial Complex which is home to the graves of the brave ones killed by Moldovan soilders during the war for independence and where the eternal flame burns in their memory. < - > Dont lie This Tank was here long before 1992.
Hate at this pathological level demands explanation beyond the obvious low intelligence. I suggest that Godnuts are secretly unconfident of their beliefs &amp; mortally terrified they might be wrong. This translates into hyper-extreme hate of anyone who credibly boosts their doubts. https://t.co/2DBlX5b9RS < - > @RichardDawkins I completely agree with you on your point about the godnuts. In addition, don't you love when they say "I'm not judging" just before or after they've rendered a judgment such as saying they expect someone is in "hell?"
Here's something it's possible to disagree with a politician and still vote for a their political party .  If said political party was doing something that's was detrimental to the country for example putting more people into poverty . Then time to reconsider voting for them. < - > If said political party releases a standard reaction on something they have very little information about other than  what they are being told by those who supposedly do. We can say we disagree and still vote for said Party . That's my tuppence worth  Disagree with me ? https://t.co/YSZAg2zCja
I would appreciate if you would reframe from calling me a racist. < - > It seems, no matter how much sourcing or facts I provide, I cannot generate any response from critics other than personal attacks about racism or Wikipedia history.
it would be great. < - > Are you sure that would be great?!
That's fine those future voters will not reelect you and outlive you too can't wait to see what the history textbooks our generation writes will have to say about people like you https://t.co/96wQvE1cNA  *cough cough its called the first amendment. < - > @davidhogg111 @pattonoswalt FREEDOM, FREEDOM, FREEDOM ......unless you disagree with gun nuts and their republican stooges, then just shut up.
Omitting the scandals is in keeping with the historical perspective encouraged by WP:LEAD. < - > Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD.
''Modern challenges and controversies faced by the church include the church-condemned liberation theology; its stance on issues such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, homosexuality, and the ordination of women; and a sex abuse scandal.'' It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are ''wrong'' to be anti-death/pro-life. < - > I can see your point and it makes complete sense to me. However, I think we will be hit over the head a few times if we dont have any controversies noted in the lead.
He's taking a radical position in the god-no god debate (if you believe in God, you're a crank.) So if he's going to be included, it seems fair to me to include some radical stuff from the other side of the debate. < - > I completely disagree with your claim that Sam Harris is radical, extremist or any of those other designations. Sam Harris assumes an activist role, but it most certainly isn't outside the mainstream.
The new English reformation paragraph could readYou still get the message that Catholics were persecuted and that some Protestants were persecuted, but without unnecessary details that swing it toward pro-Catholic POV. < - > Changing it will make it POV anti-Catholic and factually lacking.
''you seem to have already decided for yourself what you think atheism is'' - I would say that my understanding of atheism seems wholly supported by the majority of sources presented, I would have to ask why it is that your understanding is different. < - > Well, I've read the sources. They don't say what you claim they say.

Sean Penn Novel: Trump's America 'A Nation In Need Of An Assassin' https://t.co/59EJL5IG3r < - > @realDailyWire right because if you disagree with someone just kill them!
According to these tweets, Adrienne intends to sit in her own ass. https://t.co/BVWKBS0Auz < - > @TricepBrah ... but in my capacity as a friend and colleague, I strongly disagree w/ her assertion that you ~"do not take pride in your sad, pathetic, existence. "   I maintain that you most certainly DO! :\
If Canada has strong national ties to any date format it is to YYYY-MM-DD, which appears on a great many official Canadian government documents and websites (and is also the easiest to sort and shortest to write). < - > Suggesting that Canada somehow has strong national ties to ISO because you found some instances where it is used there is silly. It is used quite a lot in US military and certain US academic circles; does that somehow mean ISO has strong US ties?
Um, Britain and France declared war on Germany as a direct result of their guarantees to Poland, do you not recall the British ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from Poland? < - > The guaranty to some country is not an alliance.
Wassap, I don't see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short. < - > I - for one - do not think this article is NPOV.
Perhaps 'The USSR joined the war against the Axis' might be a better phrasing? < - > Saying that the USSR joined the war against the Axis is a bit confusing: this implies that it made an active decision to join the war when in fact it was invaded (and taken by surprise) and the USSR only fought the countries which had invaded it.
Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.-- < - > Paul, this is apparent amateur revisionism is tiresome.
These clearly have different meanings. < - > Zionist regime and Zionist entity are one and the same.
Perhaps you could do us the courtesy of specifying where WP:CITE contradicts Template:Cite book, OR says anything about not having accessdates. I've looked pretty thoroughly, and all I see is that is not listed as COMMON for books with no url to begin with. < - > There is a contradiction, though: WP:CITE#Links and ID numbers says, ''For web-only sources with no publication date you should include a ''Retrieved'' date instead, in case the webpage changes in the future.'' (Emphasis added.) The ''Web pages'' subsection of ''Examples'', and only that subsection, lists among things typically to be included ''the date you retrieved it (required if the publication date is unknown)''.
Again, Neilsen is talking mostly about agnosticism there, and the contrast with ''the atheist'' does not clearly state whether he means ALL atheists or a subgroup of atheists (or even the singular) - as such, presenting it as definitional of atheism is telling the wiki-reader to read too much into it. < - > Given that Nielsen has not indicated that he uses 'an atheist' differently than 'an agnostic' and that he is clearly talking about all agnostics in using that phrasing I would say that you are probably reading too much into it, or at least bear the burden of an extraordinary claim.
100% agree. https://t.co/9H0tASc0Bk < - > @Bridget_Brown_ 100% disagree
you are fabulous, but you're looking thin! < - > I still can't fit into my jeans.
It wasn't until August 1945 that the USSR declared war on Japan - until this time it had been neutral towards the Japanese, despite them being a member of the Axis. < - > the USSR actually did join the Allies in a formal way (treaty with Britain etc)--it did not have to do so--note the US did NOT join the Allies in 1917 and Finland (fighting Russia) did not join the Axis.
If we MUST name Ireland and Britain with a group name, why not name it something less controversial, like ''West European Isles''. < - > Because that is not the common name. This has been discussed over and over again. Read the relevant sections.
Adding urls does not conflict with WP:CITEVAR. Changing from APA to MLA would be an example conflicting with CITEVAR-- < - > Per WP:CITEVAR, the original citation style (ie. without links) remains unless and until there is consensus here to change it.
Oklahoma to use gas for executions... https://t.co/wMghcJinZD < - > @DRUDGE_REPORT Don't agree with the death sentence but at least an inert gas like nitrogen is painless. Some people will say they should suffer but that's the mark of a vengeful society, not a just one.
When someone you were once friendly with unfollows you https://t.co/YBf95E34iH < - > @ItsAshleyJohn Lol obviously no great loss. Don't understand people that want everyone to just agree with them. What a boring world they must live in.
Cybercast New Service is not a neutral source. < - > Although there was a connection at one time, that does not mean that the research put out by this institute currently is biased.
I read this section on the reasoning for not creating a ''personal life'' section and still don't see why a personal life section has not been created. < - > Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability.
There may be additional fictional forces as well due to the coordinate system you pick, but that's not the same thing at all. < - > Once again, all fictitious forces are ''coordinate dependent things'', so your comment is a complete non-sequitur.
RT @USUN: Let me make one thing clear from the start, the United States stands in absolute solidarity with Great Britain. We believe that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military grade nerve agent. https://t.co/wrJxV9NGGH < - > @nikkihaley @USUN I love this lady. So strong. She should be the envy of every woman. Even if you don't agree with the politics. She cuts straight threw the BS the I can't stand. Roll up your sleeves and get s#!t done.
Since dancehall is a subgenre of reggae, I'd suggest listing Her as Contemporary R&B (which includes hip hop/rap), Reggae, Pop music (which includes dance-pop), and Rock music. < - > No.
Neuromancer's use of the talk page for agenda soapboxing is inappropriate per WP:TALK. < - > Additionally, THIS IS NOT my soap box.
Never stop punching nazis https://t.co/R6ggEtKGx5 < - > @jephjacques Got to disagree with you here. Legitimation of extralegal violence will not lead to pretty things.
I agree with you, however, as a practical matter, if we can establish consensus and get the page unprotected by adopting a very strict version of neutrality, that will be good for Wikipedia. < - > It wouldn't be 'adopting a very strict version of neutrality', it would be adopting an incorrect misinterpretation of the policy, one that is specifically outlined as incorrect in the policy.
Yeah, especially the whole thing's starting to die down a bit. < - > Though it seems that on March 5, 2009, it's getting bigger, not dying down.
Uncle Remus was a slave and the stories came from slavery days. < - > except, that the stories didnt actually come from the days of slavery.
Had the pleasure of meeting my brother @UKenyatta for discussions on issues afflicting Kenya. We have resolved that the future our nation is more important than any sole individual https://t.co/l9Knre4TBS < - > @RailaOdinga @UKenyatta I totally DISAGREE with Hon.Raila Odinga! He waited until it was too late to negotiate with Hon.Uhuru. Many lost their lifes, some are now disabled and others got serious injuries because they were supporting him.This should teach Kenyans a lesson.I stand to be corrected.
There are no reliable sources that assert a Muslim heritage, so Snopes is entirely adequate to refute such nonsense. < - > How is a book, written by the man in question himself, not a reliable source?
College students now care more about diversity and inclusion than free speech.  If this trend persists, the American experiment will fail. https://t.co/OEltSPICKa < - > @TuckerCarlson THE SAD FACT IS THAT AMERICAN YOUTH ARE ESSENTIALLY FASCISTS. They believe in violence, and intimidation to squelch any idea they disagree with. They have no idea about fundamental American values. They have been brainwashed by academia, Hollywood, and the leftist media.
if you stayed home, and are a republican, then you did your state a favor by not voting.... < - > And just because they might be republican, doesn't mean they are a bad person.
Oh cool, Fox News is into athletes speaking on political issues now https://t.co/A5zRRI6aX4 < - > @JuddLegum @Miduswell It all depends on the wether they agree with them or not. If they disagree, they will be silenced.
So far, you have repeatedly said that everything necessary has already been provided by you. However, your criteria for clear and documented presentation falls a bit short for the Great Unwashed. < - > As has already been explained repeatedly and at length, the references you mentioned (along with many others) explicitly support what I'm saying, and contradict what you are saying. I've pointed out that you mis-understand and therefore mis-represent those references.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity.
Wikipedia isn't about negative information and positive information, it's just information. < - > If Bush's front page for example is going to mention nice little subtlely negative implications and the controversies and criticisms surrounding his policies, and on just about every part of his bio, Obama's should too.
Condolences to the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends. I know each of you were in the running. https://t.co/5T59Ngnbxk < - > @RepSwalwell Rep Swalwell...Not sure basis of the comparison, but it is ludicrous.  Kudlow was on a TV show, but he worked in Reagan Budget Office doing economics and has been involved in the political world since. You may disagree with him, but he is qualified.
Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history! < - > @realDonaldTrump I think the people disagree. The blue tide has come! Why, in my own home State of Pennsylvania, Mr. Rick Saccone just got his ass handed to him by Democrat Conor Lamb in a deep red district that you won by 20 points. I think people are waking up to the truth about your failings.
Why isn't there a Gini category which says that United States' Gini is high, beside the Gini number? < - > That information is included in the infobox.
Nelson over Crabtree without Rodgers does not seem smart https://t.co/O67aZKi4Q4 < - > @allinkid I respect your fantasy game to crazy high levels, but disagree here
Contrary to popular belief, Buddhism is NOT a religion nor a philosophy. < - > The consensus view in scholarship is that Buddhism is essentially religion, which is often qualified in some way, so as to not lead people to believe that it is the same notion of religion as in Abrahamic religions. The Shaolin Temple's website just gives a very broad and simplified overview of Buddhism, and is not really an appropriate reference for a page such as this.
not sure why but I have a huge vendetta against Caroline Flack, so irritating < - > @joaj28 can't believe we agree on two things now how much we love Stacey Dooley and how much we dont like Caroline Flack

Give them hell, folks. < - > @MikeStuchbery_ @BrittPettibone @Martin_Sellner @TRobinsonNewEra @lutzbofficial Typical Antifa bell end. "I don't agree with you so we will behave like dickheads" because that'll teach you. Fucking pork chop.
If they are going to mention the criticism of the Bush policies or things he ''allegedly'' did or didn't do, which they make sure they included on his front page, then do it with Obama and his policies, on his front page. < - > You don't balance out articles by putting the same amount of criticism in one because this much is in the other, anymore than you determine how many characters, pictures or quotes appear in each article.
Seriously though the dollar sign alone, as its symbolism was used in Atlas Shrugged, is the best choice. < - > Atlas Shrugged is hardly a cornerstone of capitalism. Plus, in that dubious book the dollar sign isn't just the symbol of capitalism; it's also the monogram of the US and is tied to some odd ideas about gold.
I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact. < - > This version is better, but I'm still not 100% with it.

I love my audience. https://t.co/tbbaKgM6iq < - > @Styx666Official I had no idea who Right Wing Watch is but after seeing your video about Jared Holt I am finally following you here. I watch about 75% of your videos now, even if I don't agree with your stance.
The New York Times was and still is considered one of the most accurate news publications in existence (have you, by any chance, ever read an issue?), instead of a conveniently unnamed westerner who you claim is biased against Muslims but still likes to blame Armenians. < - > The NY Times was working off of this same propaganda -- reports that came to Westerners from Armenians in the West, and were often further exaggerated by the Europeans.
Making a blanket statement that you will not honor the community consensus, regardless of what it is, is probably not going to be helpful to you or your position, and throws up a major red flag in terms of your ability to engage in wikipedia productively. I would suggest rephrasing the question yourself, right here, instead, as being a rather more productive avenue. < - > That's a misrepresentation of what I have said. I will not support this RFC - this has nothing to do with ''honoring community consensus''.
I had a lot of comments beyond the two that Nancy pulled out to ask for consensus about, and I thought it would be easier for those working to update the article to put those with any other PR comments than have them here on the talk page. < - > Yeah, but now if someone new does look at the peer review page they may decide taht since it appears to have already been reviewed, they may as well look at some other article.
Those panels look GREAT! < - > I think the first panel could be done more simplistically and effectively.
lol........really??.......you serious??.........you're going to take that position??........''definition'' or not.........(Geneva Conventions were created by Politicians)......you're going to justify dropping bombs on city centers and in the middle of civilian populations by saying they're ''military targets''???....this position may be accepted by international POLITICS........NOT the average person............to find the references for that.........ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK........anyways........I know this section is about defining ''terrorist tactics''........you obviously would like to use ''international political definitions'' when it suits your position (as you just stated) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted (as stated above with the U.N. < - > I never said the ''civilian populations'' are ''military targets''.
This is a biography cover his entire life. < - > Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now.

Here's an example of the kind of introduction that I think would be appropriate, accurate, and NPOV for the current article. < - > That is your opinion. It is not mine.
This looks like a worthwhile link as a reference for the paragraph, which presumably should have ''open systems'' changed to ''isolated systems''. < - > I think we should stick to peer-reviewed journal articles and material published by well-respected scientists at major universities.
Interesting! https://t.co/rroMkZbF0L < - > @melsariffodeen This has been discussed frequently in the past few years at the @gendersummit although I disagree that it's because women get to pursue their passion because of economic freedom.  It's not enough to just legislate gender equity and parity.

Why add many extra steps for people who want to check sources?-- < - > Clicking on the ISBN works right for more people than do GBooks links.
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > Being forward is great and all, but there are times when you need to approach things a little more carefully to avoid any unnecessary conflict.
A quote can easily state, ''translated by the gift and power of god'' as long as it is attributed or referenced. < - > I disagree.
Bush article contains the word ''criticism'' ten times, twice in the lead. < - > It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure, but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it.
I thus suggest that we create a second disclaimer, such as, ''The following statistical resources may be created by those with a non-neutral position in the abortion debate.'' Site such sites as the AGI and Johnston's Archive, unfortunately, fall into a grey area between purely neutral parties and clear-cut advocacy groups. < - > I'm skeptical about listing them as biased when the other organizations there are clearly pushing one or the other agenda, whereas most of what AGI does is research.
The point is that when you make a pipe, you don't call the link ''an oil rig'' and then link to a specific named rig. < - > As to your point about piping, I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic.
That being said, it is a FACT that there is no empirical evidence that HIV causes AIDS, even if it is a generally accepted theory. < - > There's plenty of evidence that HIV causes AIDS.

No such claim is being made by any of the three psychology professors. < - > I have no problem with reading comprehension. It seems to me that the fact that astrology is rank pseudoscience as seen in practically every last non-major introductory astronomy textbook on the market should be more prominently described in this article and the fact that its champions have difficulty publishing in journals that are on par with where their critics have been published means that, unfortunately for the believers in hokum, that's the verifiable and reliable facts on the ground.
In dynamics the coordinate systems are four-dimensional, including a time dimension. < - > You amaze me by suggesting that the fact time is a coordinate has a role in all this. You also wander off-topic to repeat how impeccable your arguments always are blah-blah. Here is the question you raised: So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other? And here is the rub: there are two usages of ''fictitious force''. In the approach of Stommel and Moore, in a inertial frame there are fictitious forces if (and only if) you use curvilinear coordinates. On the other hand, in a non-inertial frame there are ''additional'' fictitious forces due to acceleration of the frame relative to an inertial frame. The quotations I have provided (with links where you can read the entire discussion surrounding these quotes) provide their discussion for the case of polar coordinates. Despite this answer to your question, I am sure you will say that I have misread Stommel and Moore, but that you will not go into any detail why that is so. Instead, you will wander off and explain your noble quest for sanity in a desert of ignorance.
Or with just ''now'' in place of ''which later became''. < - > Just ''now'' doesn't seem as clear.
There is no reason other than ideological bias that would prevent abortion images being put on this page. < - > On the contrary, Ros, the only reason for adding such images would be ideological bias.
It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly. < - > Well, the news media thinks it has something to do with him.

Sometimes a good game can play badly; one of the great things about games is they're starting to push past standard definitions of what makes a game "quality." My oped: https://t.co/JKlDjgJGJa https://t.co/pqb0wAb41P < - > @DigitallyDownld I quite disagree with you, BTW. Not because we think differently about a fish fighting game, but rather because I consider your position to be that of a person spoiled with too much time on their hands. As the opposite, I expect more.
I really think we should take out that paragraph. < - > Regarding the deletion - I'd personally leave it there.

I am waiting for IG Michael Horowitz to report on NY FBI and Rudy Giuliani manipulating FBI to deep six Clinton; if he ignores that, his recommendation to fire McCabe reeks of manipulation https://t.co/7ScvpmPWPS < - > @NormOrnstein I agree!  We don't have the details we need on the involvement of the disgusting Guilani &amp; his partisans in the NY FBI.  If these agents performed any actions for political reasons, they need to be identified and disciplined.  The last thing this country needs is more infighting.

The WP:RS are unanimous: HIV causes AIDS. < - > You cannot say that EVERY RS in the world is unanimous on the topic that HIV is 100% the cause of AIDS.
Concerning suicide bombings, they cannot be solely attributed Hamas. < - > Hamas never hid its involvement in planning and executing suicide bombings.
When we're in the middleground of sources, which perhaps spans from Fox News and Wall Street Journal on the right to Time Magazine and Salon.com on the left, we still have to look to see whether it's an editorial opinion piece, commentary, analysis, rhetorical flourish, interview, whatever. < - > If you ask me, it's somewhat uncivil to equate Fox News and Wall Street Journal to Time Magazine and Salon.com. If Time equals Wall Street Journal on opposite sides, then does Salon equals Fox News?

I note that User:Neuromancer copied the section ''HIV discovery'' from the unreliable ''virusmyth'' website, while the ''HIV Types, Groups and Subtypes'' subsection was copied word-for-word from the site [5]. < - > However, I did not copy it.
I think it's fair to say that neither is ''better'', but it's interesting to see the way the different approaches go. < - > It's not just a readability aspect, they actually look worse.

My proposal is to replace the single CoA of the UK with an image displaying both versions of the UK CoA currently in use. < - > Keep the single image, with a note as suggested, linking to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom article.

Rename WB in the 21C whatever you want, just get the recentist stuff about america cut down in this article so this can be the ''article giving the wider view in terms of both history and geography'' that it should be. < - > I think not. You continue to miss the point.
So far, you have repeatedly said that everything necessary has already been provided by you. However, your criteria for clear and documented presentation falls a bit short for the Great Unwashed. < - > I've given you several references, such as Friedman, that explain all this in great detail.

Hancock denies misrepresenting Leveson's letter. Says he "faithfully represented"it. Is told by MP Ian Lucas that he would prefer honesty and straightforwardness in a Secretary of State. < - > @stevenjbarnett For the record: @MattHancock said #Leveson "agrees that the Inquiry should not proceed" while Leveson actually said "I fundamentally disagree" with the Gov't's conclusion &amp; urged them to consider "the need for at least the bulk of Part Two to be commenced as soon as possible"

That entire subject of this article is nothing but coordinate dependent things, namely, fictitious forces. < - > This article is NOT Centrifugal force (coordinate dependent things)!!! This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame).
If you want to say that a particular view is the ''consensus'', then you need sources that demonstrate that it is the consensus. I haven't seen any. < - > I can't prove a the majority of an unbounded set, but I can state that for the set currently available to us the case seems made that the majority of them do support the usage in EBC: ''atheism is a positive denial''.
I know this is a touchy area, and ''Negro'' is also a word which is considered offensive for historical reasons, however I think we need a better title, and one that corresponds better with ''African Americans''... < - > One issue with changing the title to reflect African origin is that not all groups labeled ''black'' are connected to Africa. The last sentence of the intro reads: Other definitions of the term Black extend to any of the populations characterized by dark skin, a definition that also includes certain populations in Oceania, Southeast Asia.[1][2].
Hip-hop has always been the lowest common denominator when it comes to music. Punk as well, but I listened to both because they had a point of view that fucked with the mainstream narrative. Now both genres simply fall in line. The only anti-establishment left is you and me. < - > @DaytonDoes When you say "lowest common denominator" regarding the music, do you mean like technically? If so I'd have to disagree, unless you can prove to me you can play guitar like East Bay Ray.  ...&amp; If you can, why are we not in a band already?
I'm glad @RAVerBruggen took the time to explain why that @washingtonpost article defending Clinton's comments was so lame. Or at least some of the reasons. https://t.co/F8FiXIU7Kc < - > @JonahNRO @RAVerBruggen @washingtonpost Why does this seem like she's falling on a sword to further their cause? Watch  the dems condemn her and try to look as if they don't agree.

I have done something similar to the above suggestions, mostly becuase the term ''pro-life'' does not apply directly to contraception (regardless of what we think about it otherwise). < - > ''Pro-life'' actually does apply directly to contraception, from a Catholic understanding, because of both ''emergency contraception'' (which many argue is abortion) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life.
Kudlow tells AP he's accepted White House economics job, opposes tariffs but is `in accord' with Trump's policies. https://t.co/QfQaqlyyJY < - > @AP I disagree but I'll do whatever he tells me to
Perhaps 'The USSR joined the war against the Axis' might be a better phrasing? < - > Saying that the USSR joined the war against the Axis is a bit confusing: this implies that it made an active decision to join the war when in fact it was invaded (and taken by surprise) and the USSR only fought the countries which had invaded it.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I agree that this new information, although interesting, should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges.

We do not need to indentify different POVs which are all covered in the article, we only need an introduction that works with all of the views in the article, which is now the case. < - > Actually we do need to mention the different POV's mentioned in the article. A good introduction summarizes the contents of the article.
Discuss the move of the Marketing section in the TMT article in the Talk page of this article. < - > I don't see the need for more discussion over it, another Rfc, or a re-application of the NPOV tag, but let's take it as it comes.

I was thinking myself that it wasn't really a lead matter, and since that sentence is duplicated virtually word for word at its proper place in the article, it should go. < - > After considering the sentence everyone is discussing about removing in the lead, I think it really fits and ties up well the sentences that precede it.
I have no words. https://t.co/bJNiHkozx7 < - > @AnnTelnaes It was probably a real stretch for this man to reply. Whether you agree with him or not it was not right to make fun of him.

The newly edited introduction for this article sounds too ambiguous and it severely lacks succinctness and conciseness. I think when people want to quickly read information about a specific topic, they don't want an obscurely dull and time consuming introduction that explains why capitalism is difficult to define. < - > It is a complicated topic.
It doesn't matter how Atheists were defining atheism - let me make that absolutely clear. What matters is what the consensus position on the what the word means, if that consensus definition and that which you argue is preferred by atheists is one and the same then there is no issue. < - > Obviously, Unomi, it does matter how atheists have defined atheism.
Robert de Niro's got more words for President @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/ipDcYbPEwH https://t.co/XO5izblPHO < - > @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trump insults everyone that doesn't agree with him. The problem is that he can dish out but he can't take it. Who fires someone through a tweet? A BULLY . . . how can we expect him to negotiate with Kim Jong Un? Or anyone on our behalf.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose. IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it.
I have enough good faith to assume that editors commenting on this issue have read into it, and are not blindly agreeing with Dominus without considered opinions of their own. If you disagree with Dominus' assessment, the correct avenue is to either present alternate arguments in opposition to his, or to propose an alternate phrasing with a clear explanation of what issues the new phrasing corrects. Saying you refuse to accept community consensus without first making any effort to correct these perceived problems is bad form. < - > Same comment to your comment. Arguments resulting from misrepresentation have no relevance. You also do not understand my position with respect to reaching consensus, which does not include RFCs at this point for stated reasons.
You'll need 125 years to save enough money to retire on https://t.co/kpvKFo4XvW https://t.co/9rQ3eljfUN < - > @MirrorMoney Those of us that are there and living in the lap of luxury on seven grand a year, may tend to disagree.
Capitalism is a descriptive term not an ideology. It means that the means of production are privately owned. Whether the owners allow free markets or enforce monopolies, or get the government to subsidize or own loss-making industries like public transit makes no difference. < - > I wasn't suggesting that it was an ideology. I was talking about the definition and academic understanding of ''what is capitalism?'' It's not simply a ''descriptive term,'' and it's not necessarily true that, in a capitalist economic system, the means of production are privately owned.
Amid mounting tensions between the UK and Russia, former SNP leader Alex Salmond should axe his RT show, writes @tompeterkin  https://t.co/LZO9be52XR < - > @TheScotsman @TomPeterkin I completely DISAGREE! Alex gave an EXCELLENT speech this morning, I applaud him for standing up to the establishment!
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > Ok, that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea.
It is primarily a US scandal, and, despite trawling the internet, no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal. < - > I didn't have to 'trawl' the internet to get the above story.
don't play the victim now because you made a sick joke you took too far and are getting hate for it. https://t.co/vrDDH1MgRN < - > @archiebettyOTP Preach! This person is seriously hateful. I just found out that they blocked me, when I am pretty sure I have never talked to them. They just block any account they don't agree with. And what they did to you is awful. Especially when they're saying it's a joke, there is a line!
A Neutral view is that the genocide occurred, and that it was carried out by the Ottomans, anything else is ludicrous. < - > If everything else is 'ludicrous' as you say, then why are there so many that do not believe in the point (notice no plural amount being represented in the article) of view?
The snapshot of the arguments has been presented by the proposer of the RfC in a simplified and misleading way to the extent that the well was poisoned. This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > Sour grapes. If you can't win the argument, say that the argument was rigged.
Hillary Clinton sprains hand after slipping on stairs in India: Report https://t.co/rMzeuRyoSQ https://t.co/fNhp3rnXSN < - > @dcexaminer I will never wish harm to anyone I disagree with. Wishing her a speedy recovery!
Your proposal, by glossing over what went on during the Reformation, (see for example Prayer Book Rebellion, dissolution of the monasteries), is actually more POV in showing only Catholics as persecutors. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.
Flat out untrue. See https://t.co/G38GPvv6dR How can you *be* so ignorant,  and still manage to get dressed in the morning. ? https://t.co/1FnhOCF5Nr < - > @ClarkeMicah Gotta disagree you with this. These were all criminal thugs, all criminals smoke weed because they have no regard for the law and are losers. This is a correlation not a causation.
The article was stable with Google Book links going back at least as far as February. < - > Just to be clear an edit made 3 months ago is no longer a bold edit (as tens of thousands have seen the edits since there inclusion 3 months ago)- There removal 3 months later however was the bold edit - as the edit (removal of links) has been contested by 2 editors in a reasonable amount of time (now 3).
Civilian supremacy has always been a part of intellectual, academic discussions,never a public discourse or movement.

The ambiguity belonged to the other dominions; Canada was at the forefront of getting the Balfour Declaration accepted and the Statute of Westminster passed, and, unlike Australia and New Zealand, who delayed for years, accepted it as law as soon as was possible. < - > You'll need to back up this story with references.
By the way, the fact that it's obvious to everyone that this material exists to ''debunk the creationist ''2nd law'' claim'' is why I think it should be moved to the section on creation vs. < - > Really this is two misunderstandings mixed up together, one about the 2nd law in general and another about the application of the 2nd law to biological processes.
This discussion about the use of the word ''deportations'' is over as far as I am concerned. < - > And I certainly don't regard the discussion as closed just because you say so and I think others need to weigh in on this.
Wikt:practical: ''Being likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation; able to be put to use.'' I cannot fathom how Astronomy fits that definition, or will fit that definition until humanity gains an advantage from it aside from the theoretical (theory being the antonym). < - > But, the finiteness of the speed of light is indeed ''likely to be effective and applicable to a real situation'', namely to the creation of theories about stellar and galactic evolution.

If the #Giants sit at #2 and DON'T secure their future franchise QB, they are absolutely out their minds. As tantalizing as Barkley is, QB is the only play.   Have to brush sentimentality aside, sadly. #NFLDraft2018 < - > @BrandonTierney Couldn't disagree more. Team is in win now mode. Should the team fall apart again in '18 and have a high draft pick, the opportunity will present itself again.  Also, DG has a lot of faith in Davis Webb. So, I wouldn't dismiss him just yet either...#Giants
This implies the mindset that it's some external force influencing them, that they need to just pray against it or something. < - > It's ''pray against it, search your soul for what you have done and how to change, and take steps to rectify the wrongs and stop doing evil in order to keep the Devil at bay.''  Catholic doctrine doesn't allow ''the Devil'' as a ''get out of responsibility free'' card.
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state (it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government) so clearly they can not be interchangable. < - > But saying that the zionist regime and the zionist entity are distinct is wrong.
Found this meme. It may be the worst meme ever. It's certainly the worst one I've seen. https://t.co/J8EudjknhB < - > @amazingatheist Anyone who puts tard on the end of something is truly the pinnacle of human stupidity.  It's like "Eyyy look at me, I fused a word to describe people I disagree with and then put TARD on the end of it, you know, cause RETARD!!!! Owww me so funny".
A dog is not a living thing just like me. Dogs are creatures, and they're fun and cute and nice. They are also infinitely less valuable than humans. https://t.co/a2C4fq5l10 < - > @michaeljknowles I usually agree with you but not on your attitude towards animals. Yes, animals are less valuable than humans, but they are living creatures made by God..Our treatment of them says a lot about how we value and respect life. It does not mean they are on the same level as humans.
Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous, I'm still excited. < - > Next week's is probably going to be a disaster.
I constantly wonder why I even bother doing work, making an effort, and putting things together.  If you're going to fuck up my work, waste my time, don't even bother making me do something? Like, for fuck's sake.  I'm tired of this happening all the time? < - > That's not to say I don't understand why; I don't disagree with the reason behind it, but honestly?  If you're going to force me to up and change everything I do at your beck and call or based on whatever whim you're having at that moment, don't make me do it.
It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations, with the total number of Armenian deaths generally held to have been between one and one-and-a-half million persons. < - > forcd marches through desert areas without food/water etc) - and the claim of such (deportaion) - is entirely false - and referencing the cover story ''techir Law'' - is in fact a cover up of the (well proven) attempt at extermination and political-cultural anhiliation of the minority Armenian population through means that included (among other methods) uprooting/forced marches (of largely de-maleized populations) as well as direct massacre beyond the sight of outsiders - and these things occured in an entirely organized and massive scale throughout Anatolia - though primarily - but not limited to - the Eastern (Armenian) provinces of the Ottoman Empire.
The fact that Eliot admits that ''it is not clear'' and makes ambiguous claims about what is ''little known in the Far East'', tells me this is not important enough to mention. < - > It's perfectly clear that the phrase ''It is not clear'' refers to the Path being taught to lay people, not to the next sentence.
Some bishops demonstrably knew about the allegations of misconduct but then reassigned the accused rather than report them to the police immediately. < - > As I stated to you on my talk page, I am not OK with deleting information about the prevailing psychology saying people could be cured of this behaviour, that many of the deviant priests received counseling before being reassigned, or the statement by John Paul II in response to this information.
I will also note that Brews' identification of other viewpoints with Lagrangian formalism is skewed, and shows that he still does not understand the other points of view described in the numerous reputable references that have been cited here. < - > Please support your statement that my view is skewed.
So that's why it discusses the Spanish inquisition, the Algerian war, and the Khmer Rouge? < - > Actually, it mostly discusses CIA or American use during the Bush years (although now not mostly referring to him by name); the others are mentioned either historically or almost en passant as other repressive regimes.
Seriously it's been a very rough few days because I said sexism exists in Ag. Thanks to the ppl sending dms and tweets like this. You're the ones that have saved me. https://t.co/Z7M05sopBR < - > @MegRaeB I appreciate you. Feel fee to tag me anytime you need an ally #inthistogether we may disagree on many things, we may agree on others, but at the core is the reality that women in ag face sexism and its time we talked about it openly.
And let me repeat what I said about argumentum e silentio. If a source fails to mention an alleged basic fact, it's reasonable to conclude that it doesn't believe in it. < - > You are prevented by the policy against original research from stating such a conclusion in the article.
It's not just a readability aspect, they actually look worse. < - > And honestly, if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice, I'd probably at least consider using Safari; the stuff is more typographically ''correct'' using that rendering, which in the context of an image of a site may well look better.
I find the context of the quote describes the approach by return to an inertial frame as unnecessary. < - > I referred to the context that you provided: it is fine for when you want to use fictitious forces.
Man city will kill this Barca team https://t.co/Xuu4UTNLSt < - > @omoskool I disagree sir. Man city has no Messi.
You originally said you deleted because the claim was not in Scott's paper. < - > It's place in the source is clear only to someone who has the full source in front of them; Scott's assertion about the end of Canada's Dominion status coming on 7 September 1939 certainly isn't in the link you provided. Regardless, the claim was presented in the article not as Scott's theory but as a widely accepted fact. I think the claim is audacious precisely because I've seen no other sources say anything even remotely similar.
Just over half the people in this country no longer believe in the principles this country was founded upon. Freedom and limited government.  This country is not united and can't be united. And won't ever be united again. < - > @WalshFreedom I don't agree with everything you discuss but this topic I feel you are right on! We will never be united again. #SeparateTheUSA
The Senator made his concerns known during a press conference at the Capitol. https://t.co/n9W0fFUHRL < - > @SarahPalinUSA I don't agree with his reasons.
I am sick and tired of social media trolling and bullying. It is important to stand up for what we believe in, but surely we can achieve this through courtesy, decency &amp; respect rather than using social media as a pitchfork. Social media abuse has to stop. Stay classy everyone. < - > @JamesMelville I partly disagree. The Suffragettes had to use forceful tactics to be heard. Drag Queens had to kick off to get gay rights on the map. Sometimes the crime is that society doesn't listen to polite requests for change. If important issues are ignored, people shout louder.
Modern Basque is not ''pre-Indo-European'' unless it hasn't changed since (Proto-)Indo-European began being spoken. < - > Dumu, I'm not sure how you figure we can't say with a fair amount of certainty it's pre-IE.
Maybe these things are of interest to people but lets give the real and full story and not just the propaganda.The real stroy is that the tank is part of Glory Memorial Complex which is home to the graves of the brave ones killed by Moldovan soilders during the war for independence and where the eternal flame burns in their memory. < - > Mark, yours may well be the version of the story taught to Transnistrian kindergarteners.
This should shock no one.  In elections, the Green Party has been nothing more than a Dem spoiler for nearly two decades. https://t.co/H0YuljLGnu < - > @HoarseWisperer I agree with you most times.  But I don't here.  You can't blame the left for voting for the Green party when they embrace Clinton and Kaine.  I went ahead and voted for Hillary.  But she basically told progressives to fuck off.  They were going for the moderate vote.
He'll never figure out why this is a self-own https://t.co/JAc88fdzRL < - > @notwokieleaks I disagree.  The weirdest thing is that despite these constant claims, actually explaining what makes communism different from capitalism at a government level is almost always a discussion of intent and not actual mechanics.

Keep up the good fight, David!
Also the term ''modern'' is entirely POV too in the ''modern'' day the Church has 1,130,000,000 followers, modern people, who by choice of their faith do not agree with killing unborn babies either. < - > I was OK with the sentence, I took it to mean issues that have just been brought up in the Modern era as opposed to issues like heresy in the Roman empire age.
Shame on any parent allowing their kid to participate in this pointless #NationalWalkoutDay < - > @mflynnJR In the 60s and 70s, many participated in protests, and issues of the day were topics covered in Civics class. We learned more from active participation in government process - including peaceful protest - than we ever did in class. Just b/c you disagree, doesn't make it wrong.
The major civil rights historians (David Garrow, Taylor Branch, Adam Fairclough) know that this data is accurate, and Garrow even proofread further manuscripts. < - > I observe again that neither Branch nor Garrow has written anything anywhere that might be understood to express the view that Bevel was even nearly as important as King and/or far more important than any other civil right movement leader besides King.

You fuckers saying Stephen Hawking is "free" from his wheelchair now: Disabled people are here, reading your tweets. Do you think we ought to die? Cause that's what you're saying, actually.  Don't you dare try to sell death as freedom.   Hawking's wheelchair was freedom. < - > @karriehiggins No, they're just giving the usual "he in heaven now" bullshit, even though the man himself would disagree. It has nothing to do with the fucking chair. Calm down.
Fictitious forces are fictitious. < - > No, fictitious forces cannot kill you. What kills you is the actual (absolute) acceleration to which you are subjected, and this actual absolute acceleration is proportional to the applied actual forces. Fictitious forces do not contribute at all to your absolute acceleration. Your comment is the kind of misunderstanding that I'm trying to eliminate from the article, by insisting that it be written clearly and correctly.
Nope. The more we learn, the more we know. "The more we learn the less we think we know" is New Age nonsense. Even when what we're outlining are new domains of inquiry, those are known unknowns. https://t.co/htcfe4tvXa < - > @omriceren Wrong. While I completely disagree with Singer's religion take, the first part is correct. Every new discovery shows us how little of the world we know (in my field, biology for instance).
I need EVERYONE living Tulare county to share this.  I was on my way to the DMV in Tulare when this heartless act against a human being. Keep in mind this individual was not armed. In the video you can hear more or less 6-8 shots fired at him. Please share and help bring justice https://t.co/CK1xNCFGZ1 < - > @JosGuti36351254 @ChaseStulo It's sad but that's what happens when you reach for a cops weapon and fight them..... I don't agree with the excessive shots but sadly the cop wasn't in the wrong.
Are you going to add a delay/cast time to Tracers pulse bomb @PlayOverwatch ? What is the cast time for Pulse Bomb? .05 secs? "pros" complain sombra doesn't give you time to react. Neither does Widowmaker, Tracer. put sombra back &amp; stop nerfing things unnecessarily. < - > I wont disagree that Sombras LOS is off but its balanced by the fact that she is easily detected if within range. And her hack can be interrupted if she has taken damage @PlayOverwatch Are you going you add the same disadvantages to Tracer &amp;  widomaker? take damage cant blink?
You can make all of those same points of contention about the Holocaust, the only difference is that Turkey still retains the same racist culture, whereas Germany has changed, and refrains from further ruining its reputation by insulting its victims. < - > Germany did not come to terms with its genocide because they wanted to, they were forced to do so after being defeated.
Once a day everyday. Ok sometimes more then once.  @GreatestShowman #LOVE https://t.co/68yOjNS97w < - > @baxriko i won't disagree with you there https://t.co/kf8nBpc07N https://t.co/dTaTqhwl4u
If we're going to name categories, those names and categories must be based on external sources that meet our verifiability standards. < - > However, I do not see why 'highest third', 'lowest quarter' etc.
Please remember that Buddhism is NOT a religion, it is primarily a philosophy, and therefore ''a way of life''. < - > Huttick, the Catholic Church believes Buddhism isn't a religion. But Buddhists and religious scholars regard it as a religion.
#DiscreditReddit #EndCensorship #InternetBillsOfRights #NationalWalkoutDay  @POTUS https://t.co/xcnJGliFRZ < - > @Pouissant1 @POTUS Huh, a private business denying service to those they disagree with. Where have I heard that before...
I'm afraid ''Obama's Katrina'' has all the hallmarks of a senseless political meme, like calling everything ''-gate''. < - > Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article.
Rihanna ''allegedly'' getting beat up by Chris Brown is not trivial either, seeing as it directly intertwined with her career (as in cancelling an appearance and bruising her face/body, which are essential to her career). < - > Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability.
Ros is new to Wikipedia, and, thus, is probably unfamiliar with its intent. < - > Ros Power, you are just another twat pushing his POV here.
Anyone else think that #calgary garbage pick up being every 2 weeks now is not enough? Compost could be every other week but garbage should be weekly. @nenshi @gccarra < - > @_sir @nenshi @gccarra Nope. Disagree completely. If you need weekly garbage p/u you're doing something wrong. We only put black bins out about every 4th week here.
Trump remakes America in his own image: Angry, hateful, afraid | Jill Filipovic https://t.co/7osWgBMQZ3 < - > @SafetyPinDaily I'm not defending tRump, but I disagree with supposition that he is "remaking US in his image.."   We will be remiss in ignoring that he is simply amplifying US hatred &amp; fear. The hatred has been here for years.   It's time for US to admit that it created the monster.
One final note, though - there's nothing special about the population density of the Gaza strip, which is similar to (and actually lower than many) other urban areas in the world. < - > The Gaza population density is 4118/km2 which is ranked the 2nd densest urban area in the world.
It is therefore sensible, even for the sceptical argument, to make brief, objectively reported reference to the notable criticisms, and to give reference to other sources that detail them more fully. To not give some kind of representation feeds right into the hands of conspiracy theorists. < - > Serious criticisms are published in other peer reviewed journals, not in astrology fanzines - that has been the entire point of almost every oppose in this RfC.
However, I can understand their motivations, in that they are wishing to ''humanize'' and ''personalize'', abortion, and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images. < - > (I dispute that this is a ''functional'' tactic, as you put it; for various reasons, it almost invariably backfires on the anti-abortionist who presents the image.
The relevence to the rest of the world and its media, including places where the religion is more present, is highly questionable''. < - > The scandals have not been covered only in the US (nor have they occured only in the US).
A midfield two of Kante and Fabregas has never been the best combination in big games this season, hope they both put in a shift tonight < - > @nbsulymanFC Disagree they've both played together before and Chelsea won the match, get your facts right
I think that B qualifies as a ''Practical effect'' of A, or even better as a ''Practical consequence'', or, if you like, as a ''Useful consequence'', or as a ''Useful effect'', or as a ''Useful application''. < - > I guess this is what happens when you come to a page frequented by science geeks (not an insult: I'm one too). The ability to measure a distant star is considered ''practical'' on the same level as everyday usage of a computer or a GPS.
Man, Joshua Morrow and Sharon Case still have that same incredible chemistry that made fans fall in love with Nick and Sharon all those years ago. #YR < - > @soapsindepthcbs I disagree JM character nick hase been written to be so disgustedly hypocritical to SC character sharon for so long it's and epic turn off to much is overlook #yr
That is why this article has NPOV issues. < - > But to me your whole crusading attitude on this subjects seems to me very POV.
For 18 months @NickSommerlad and I have investigated child sexual exploitation in #Telford. Here are our shocking findings #CSE https://t.co/aozsOFm0ra < - > @geraldine_mck @NickSommerlad Politically I don't agree with anything your paper stands for but.   Keep going with this, because it needs to be exposed and out there in the public domain. Your doing a very important job.
They have no place in the introduction. < - > Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD.
Loath as I am to defend United Airlines, people: stop bringing your dogs everywhere. They don't belong on airplanes, they don't belong in restaurants. Fee-Fee will survive for an hour or two without you. If you aren't blind, leave the dog at home. < - > @michaeljknowles MK, must disagree. Pets become part of a family.  They travel well in the appropriate crate and I pay a large price for the space when we travel with our dog.  We also board him at home of travel does not make sense. Restaurants is another story.
The child sex abuse scandal and the abuse of aboriginal people is very significant to the Roman Catholic Church. < - > Yes, this article plainly needs more of that sort of thing.
A picture of an aborted fetus might be useful in the fetus article, but not here. < - > I think not.
If, as some people assert (I don't know whether you're one of them), Buddhism is all about the 4 NT, why do so many standard textbooks not say so? Don't you think it's a rather fundamental fact about the subject that you'd expect them to mention? In fact I haven't been able to find any scholar who says so explicitly enough to be cited as a source on WP. < - > I agree with nearly everything you say here, PJ except for the very last. if a textbook fails to make a statement about what ''Buddhism'' as a whole ''is'' we cannot assume that they aren't convinced by any claims they've heard. We can only assume that they have nothing to say on the subject. This is a huge distinction in my eyes.
So the consensus on my feed is that animals shouldn't be looked after because teenagers are THAT much more important.  Wow, just wow.   Please don't post any more cute animal tweets. Since you don't care about their welfare. < - > Clarification: People are important. Gun control is an important issue (even if I don't agree on many points). But if you insist animals aren't, I hope Dana, Crowder, &amp; the like have a field day with you.
I think the inclusion of the Hiberno-English tag is great progress as it looks like a somewhat acceptance of the reality that British Isles is simply the name for the group of islands. < - > But it's a lie, because the article is written in British English. Is there any text anywhere in the world written in Hiberno English?
As you say, this is logically and statistically supported - that's good science. < - > It is a baseless, uneducated opinion.
Software developers, remember that being an engineer means that you....  1) Adhere to a code of professional ethics. 2) Avoid oral tradition as a primary teaching method. 3) Participate often in rigorous communities of practice.  4) Only work for orgs that embrace safety culture. < - > @practicingdev It's not that I disagree, it's that this has been something that I really saw in my electrical engineering degree program and haven't seen at all since I started working in software, which means that #1 is basically impossible. Can I see an example of #1?
Oppose as I have said previously, this is undue weight to fringe sources. < - > Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.
This is relevant to the article because the original comments were questioning why there was no real coverage of savants. < - > Look, as far as your POV about AS and giftedness/difficulties the sources agree with you. But that's all we need to say: ''what do the sources say?'' The point had already been made in the discussion and that should have been the end of it.
Helllll no lol https://t.co/5Oeky0pf1U < - > @_TheLoww Lmao you disagree???!!
45 years ago today... https://t.co/jXhCFY9pK2 < - > @SenJohnMcCain @jaketapper I'm a  California democrat, and don't always agree with you, but you have my sincere gratitude, and never ending respect for your service and dedication to our country.  You are in our prayers.  Thank you Senator McCain.
girl, this not true. https://t.co/7xMxa6QUcy < - > @valjahairaa_ We can agree to disagree.
Karanacs, surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven't previously been involved in editing an article? < - > I'm not one of the main editors even though I argue here a lot; my content contributions have been very very narrowly focused although I've done a lot of copyediting.
Or how he said it Kermit Just looks kool I thought Brian Henson voiced Kermit now. < - > Brian Henson as Kermit is just a popular misconception.
Democrats are enraged about Bernie Sanders leading a youth movement. I literally don't know any young person who dislikes Bernie Sanders. < - > @hansalexrazo I've encountered social conservatives who completely disagree with Bernie who at least respect him and feel his heart's in the right place... And I'm in the heart of Trump country.
'I will always remember you' is the most bullshit thing people say to console themselves. The only thing that matters is companionship. If you are not there with someone, everything that was, becomes futile and you don't give a flying fuck about them in some time. < - > A lot of people disagree with me because they hold love in very high regard but Companionship &gt; Love The only thing that matters in the end is, who stays and who leaves. Everything else is abstract romanticism of your bullshit feelings.
Come as you are but leave a different person. If you are the same person going into church, the body of Christ needs to cut them off! If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off https://t.co/QnzSDp95P7 < - > @Jason_Johnson_1 The body of Christ needs to cut them off? That's one thing I can't agree with. Maybe after some time if a person continues in unrepentance and rejects the Lord then yes. I agree that we need judgment but, can you explain the cutting off a little more?
I don't see how any of my edits are contradictions. < - > Your own post on the page is doing the exact opposite of what you have just quoted.
Some pros and cons of his response would be nice. < - > Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now.
I nominate the paragraph on the Veleia inscriptions for deletion. < - > I really think we should take out that paragraph.
hey i'm really not < - > dude, you're the one with a ''lollerskates'' icon.
WATCH: Shapiro On Fox: Media Using High-Schoolers As 'Political Human Shields' On Gun Control https://t.co/At25N7ZJEL < - > @realDailyWire @benshapiro It was a student organized protest. I know, this is hard to believe, but not everything you disagree with is fake
Um, no. < - > Um, yes.
Some would even dispute the 1931 Statute of Westminster as granting full independence, as jurisdiction over foreign affairs remained ambiguous. < - > There was no ambiguity post-1931. The Statute of Westminster was absolutely clear: No act of the British parliament would have effect in Canada unless the Canadian government gave its consent to such.
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article.
Just to clarify my position on #CREAMTEA  I am a #creamfirst man. The end. https://t.co/BfUHabCwcV < - > @michaelxavierUK @CreamTeaSociety @CreamTeaReview @CreamTeaHour @signaturescones @nt_scones Don't like to disagree with you Michael but I'm sorry the jam should be spread on first! https://t.co/JPgTNBRECA
The point is that the manufacturer of the test does not cite any newer information, and the 1994 reference was not peer reviewed, calling it into question. < - > Neuromancer, I'm not sure why you mention the fact that Abbott ''does not cite any newer information.'' If you're suggesting that this makes the Taylor '86 and/or Rutherford '90 more reliable than Buchbinder '94, I would disagree.
These reforms set up a clear code of conduct for all dioceses to follow when faced with an allegation including alerting the authorities, conducting an investigation and removing the accused priest or employee from duty.Cheers!Cheers!I don't think that Wassupwestcoast's rewrite of the abuse scandal section is an improvement. < - > I wouldn't emphasize too much the '' the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse'' because there are still new cases coming forward.
The term 'Centrifugal force' really is used to describe force terms in polar coordinates even in inertial frames; indeed I have added that quite clearly to other articles. < - > That's not correct.
Great meeting @KyleKashuv today - an extraordinary young man with a heart for helping those around him. We had a productive discussion about bipartisan ways we can address school safety and keep kids safe. https://t.co/HoVnUvcIZl < - > @VP @GOP @KyleKashuv Then why no comment about the student walkouts all around the country and even the world.  Everyone except the GOP and NRA agree that this must end.  The students are showing the true strength of Democracy. Too bad you don't care. They will vote soon.
This is a really regressive and disappointing decision that will effectively punish those who do recycle and add to the already huge problem of illegal dumping in the City, not to mention the impact on our ability to reach our waste and carbon emission reduction targets. https://t.co/u7i01K4ZWj < - > @CByrneGreen Don't agree. It's a service to be charged for. We can't use free to incentivise behaviour because then the service has no value.
It seems clear that the current.com url is not an RS, lets start there and see if Aiken has published this somewhere more reliably. < - > current.com is Current TV, so I don't know how you can support that statement.
Einstien was never diagnosed, as far as I know. < - > Two great examples of AS sufferers: Albert Einstein and Isaac Asimov.
The problem with your version is it leaves out mention of persecution of Catholics, and many other factors. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.
Great to hear Shadow Defence Secretary @NiaGriffithMP set out on @BBCr4today in clear terms that @UKLabour accepts the responsibility of Russia for the poison attacks and that the evidence is clear. She speaks for our voters, members and MPs - and makes it clear Mr Milne does not < - > @ChukaUmunna @NiaGriffithMP @BBCr4today @UKLabour Chuka, evidence is NOT clear  and you don't agree with a  cautious ,considered response with international backing .Hmmmm
If this is indeed the case, then the article titled Waterboarding in the 21st Century is, in its title at any rate, misleadingly anachronistic and, contrary to what some of its advocates seek to avoid (i.e. an 'Anglo-American' bias), succeeds in reinforcing, more insidiously because unacknowledged, precisely that. < - > Rename WB in the 21C whatever you want, just get the recentist stuff about america cut down in this article so this can be the ''article giving the wider view in terms of both history and geography'' that it should be.
#WajirNiKenya. Instead of developing robust education policies to address recruitments,regional inequalities, @TSC_KE @TSCKenya has embarked on deliberate strategies to deny children from northern kenya their constitutional right.@Asmali77 < - > @abdikaderore @MutemiWaKiama @TSC_KE @TSCKenya @Asmali77 #WajirNiKenya i would like to disagree about the transfer of non natives. locals should have taken the challenge and encourage natives to trian as teacher s and work in their homelands. non natives are free to seek transfer since they beimg targetted
i can't believe cops would nab you for doing that < - > Its illegal because its an incredibly stupid thing to do.
Oh, and forgive me for ''playing with emotions'' as well. < - > I am not accusing you of bringing emotion into an unemotional subject.
Saying B is a practical effect of A, when B and A are both abstract sciences, seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur. < - > But nor A, nor B are abstract sciences here.
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Snow Oppose. AstroNOMers of the world UNITE! Rational thinkers abandoned astrological explanations centuries ago.
maybe it should say that Obama is the first ''openly-Black'' president? < - > Or maybe people should stop obsessing over Obama's race and leave it as it is?
Lol um no https://t.co/g8UA2gBJnE < - > @Khaaksaar__k Even I would disagree
Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose. The criticism of the Nature article by astrologers is obviously WP:FRINGE.
I don't know if you did this on purpose but you definetely followed frank miller's ''draw 7 bricks and they will get the idea'' theory. < - > I believe you mean Will Eisner's ''draw 7 bricks'' theory.
after reviewing the sources on the matter i believe the translation to something like ''wipe zionism from the pages of history'' seems to be more credible. < - > Incorrect, Aonana.
Rock is sort of an automatic for modern artist as the rock music genre encompasses anything which is not classical music or post 1950s. < - > ''Rock'' isn't some kind of big blanket category that you can put over everybody that doesn't play big-band jazz.
There is no original research. < - > You have, however, again removed the well-sourced statement that the UN backed down form a previous claim, and replaced it with you original research.
But the level of detail in a lot of the article can be reduced--the quotes are too extensive, we don't need to say much about KSM/Abu Zubaida other than that the U.S. < - > has acknowledged using waterboarding against three suspected terrorists after September 2001: KSM, Abu Zubaida, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.'''' Thats just not true, it does not give any context to those statements.
I would suggest something like: ''The Roman Catholic Church, more officially termed the Catholic Church...'' < - > Until you all back up your personal interpretation with Wikipedia precedence as I have, your argument has no weight.
I think your personally feelings & fan relationship for Rihanna is getting in the way of how her article SHOULD be. < - > 2) I like some of Rihanna's music, but I am far from what anyone would consider a diehard '' fan''.
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. < - > @realDonaldTrump Try for the truth (I know you are not goos at it) The republicans on the House intelligence committee release a report written by the  White House saying no collusion. The Democrats on the same committee disagree and were not even informed --&gt;GOP OBSTRUCTION &amp; collusion
PUBG is still better < - > @PostMalone The amount of people who switched to fortnite would disagree
But if you think Leno is funnier then Conan, Letterman, Ferguson, or even Kimmel you can just get the fuck off my friends list right now. < - > dave is just weird and lecherous and unpleasant.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > Thus, there really is no particularly good place in Wikipedia to compare the number of Roman Catholic adherents against the number of Islamic adherents.
we should hang out some morning when we both dont work, and get drunk at 9am, walk around, sober up by suppertime. < - > Are you sure that would be great?!
Instead it correctly notes that BP is the well operator, lead the cleanup / containment effort so far, and bore the brunt of the public cry for Obama to do something. < - > There's no reason to mention BP (or any of the involved corporate entities) in this biography at all.
From following the links, it becomes obvious that Obama mis-identified his 4th-grade school as being a Muslim school, when it is a secular school at which he did read the Koran (and make faces while doing so....) One year of taking a class on the Koran at the age of 10 is far different than attending a school dedicated to Islam. < - > Now back to the topic at hand, I don't think Obama ''mispoke'' when he said he attended a Muslim school.
https://t.co/SGDzFN5YZX < - > @seanhannity Cut off Federal funds today. It's just amazing that 70% of CA don't agree with the Governor and the politicians concerning illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities yet they continue to break the law.
This might as well be Huffington Post. < - > I disagree
My thought for the day: Britain has been subjected to a terrorist attack by another state and yet there is little sense of a united response. Something has changed in our society and not in a good way. We have become too atomised and patriotic social solidarity is much weakened. < - > @oflynnmep @_HenryBolton I disagree what we have become is aware of FAKE NEWS, PROPAGANDA, by all the major media outlets. We are at the stage where we don't believe anything the government say and as for the Brussels Broadcasting Corporation enough said.
(and where exactly - outside of the Ottoman Empire - were they allegedly deported to?) IMO (based on review of the scholarly/historical analysis) the word/term ''deportation'' is in fact a catch phrase of genocide deniers who attempt to minimize what actually occured - as there was no deportation (but instead what occured was uprooting [mass ethnic cleansing - if you will] of the native population and forced starvation and massacre through direct and indirect means - ie. < - > I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)?
I could see 3, certainly, but I don't think there is a massive heinous conspiracy going on. < - > I tend to class it as heinous conspiracy regardless of how coordinated the effort was as a whole.

This Telegraph article highlights the NPOV problem with this article. < - > I disagree with both of your perceptions.
I think this makes more sense - common descent is what produces biodiversity, and so it makes sense to mention biodiversity first and then common descent second; plus I think the sentences read better the other way.Drift and selection can only eliminate diversity; mutation is the only process that produces divergence. < - > Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement.
You seem to have forgotten Australia, Canada and the other countries. < - > Regarding Australia, Canada, and other members of the Commonwealth, not only I, but, importantly, Stalin, Churchill and later Roosevelt forgot them also, because what was discussed in Moscow in July 1941 was a bilateral agreement between the UK and the USSR, and the formal negotiations that took place on 21 May 1942 were the negotiations between three powers, and this negotiations resulted in signing of the totally new alliance, as far as I know.--
the tp is very clear about its desire to reduce spending across the board. challenging the tp support for reducing the size of military and ending subsides is rather laborious. < - > The thing is, the Paul family are outnumbered by TP supporters who don't want to do that.
#CatchingFeelings , which I just saw, is a beautiful film. It's nicely paced, understated, infectious characters, and- unlike some local films- does NOT try too hard. Effortless.  Great performances by everyone especially @PearlThusi @andrewbuckland1 @PunchNCream &amp; @KagisoLediga < - > @Eusebius @PearlThusi @andrewbuckland1 @PunchNCream @KagisoLediga Watched it and I disagree. Its too slow for me and there are various interesting story lines that were very interesting that should have been explored further. I think Kagiso is on the correct path though and cannot wait for his next project.
WATCH: President Trump calls reports of White House staff shake-ups "exaggerated."   "There will always be change and I think you want to see change. And I want to also see different ideas." https://t.co/b1PVNoienC < - > @MSNBC Change is how we grow, but @potus has no interest in growing. His cabinet is "changing" only because people don't agree with him; so, no, I dont want to see change. I want to see ideas that are carried through after a well-thought process.  He is incapable of that. #NotAGenius
Unless folks have sources this is just a forum discussion and should move to another website. < - > It's not conversation. It's a fact that the public voices in the TP with an interventionist foreign policy outnumber those who don't.
Is it important to label yourself a feminist if you subscribe to all the ideals and values of one? (Please feel free to tweet why as well). &lt;3 < - > @LouisePentland I will happily defend this point and urge those who disagree (and those wh agree tbh) to read 'why everyone should be a femenist' and listen to @GuiltFemPod https://t.co/6984clxrRL
I honestly don't think for an institution spanning over 2000 years the ''homosexual intercourse'' thing is important/relevent enough to warrant a mention in the intro. < - > The homosexuality issue cannot be removed.
People who sit on fences usually fall off in the end... https://t.co/dvfAMlXYpf < - > @TheNewEuropean Absolutely spot on. I tweeted similar last night and all the rabid Corbynistas think that you're warmongering for agreeing with Caroline Lucas, the Whitehouse (not usually one to disagree with Putin) and Theresa May.
I do think, that it would be helpful to add to the quote Atheists... < - > I have to say that I find your edits here somewhat perplexing.
.@RandPaul: "It almost seemed to be a little bit of glee in her voice that [Gina Haspel] actually enjoyed the torture, and I think that's not who we need to lead the @CIA...

The point is that the most common viewpoint and the one basic to the view of such texts as Taylor and of Arnol'd and of Landau and Lifshitz and of Whittiker is the one based upon centrifugal forces that vanish in a non-rotating frame, and are present in a rotating frame. < - > Brews, there seems to be something wrong about your remark that: ''The point is that the most common viewpoint and the one basic to the view of such texts as Taylor and of Arnol'd and of Landau and Lifshitz and of Whittiker is the one based upon centrifugal forces that vanish in a non-rotating frame, and are present in a rotating frame.
You said: A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. It means you're talking about a different situation than scoped by this article.- ( < - > No, you misunderstood the question. Again, the question is: What do YOU (Wolfkeeper) mean when you say you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame?
I truly believe that the reason why Bethesda is taking so long developing the elder scrolls is because of the Witcher 3. The game is so close to perfection that they'll probably need 3 or 4 more years before they can get close to what CD PROJEKT RED did. < - > @EonPlug I disagree. I think Bethesda doesnt care about witcher 3. If they did they would make fallout 4 better as they seen the project way before we did. Reason why ES is not coming out is because they are afraid of making one. Because either casual fan base or hardcore one will hate it
There are also little wording issues like The hostile criticisms of the Reformation which insert a subtle POV. < - > I think the present wording of the article is more correct than what you are suggesting.
Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD. < - > I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church.

Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY. < - > I disagree that ''Personal life sections tend to give WP:UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual's WP:NOTABILITY.'' While no one, except mostly reality show stars, become famous/notable for their personal lives, I do not believe that it's trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia.

Some editors at Astrology believe that it is appropriate to add the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature: [[4]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Oppose' WP:PARITY does not mention anywhere that a pseudoscience ''journal'' can be used to critize something published in a journal like Nature. What these pseudoscience journals can be used for is to show their views in general but not treated as an equal to a real journal.
I personally think that your edits have been very POV.Please refrain from inserting incorrect and non-factual changes into this article. < - > That would be in your eyes only.
I think we should stick to peer-reviewed journal articles and material published by well-respected scientists at major universities. < - > Might make a suitable external link, however.
A frame of reference is a set of axes which you use to measure positions, positions which may then be expressed in a coordinate system. Coordinate systems are not the same as reference frames, and it's common to measure a position according to multiple coordinate systems on Earth for example. < - > You say ''a frame is a set of axes which you use to measure positions'', and then you go on to say ''positions may then be expressed in a coordinate system''. How exactly do you ''measure positions'' without a coordinate system? A set of axes IS a coordinate system. Hence the name ''coordinate axes''. Look, this has all been explained (as has everything else) previously. A frame is an equivalence class of mutually stationary coordinate systems. And one again, the choice of a coordinate system, or a class of coordinate systems, does not change any physical events. It may change the terms of your description of the events, but it doesn't change the events themselves.

Sex workin' moms (and sex workin' moms-to-be) are a special kind of badass.
On the ''sex scandal'' front I think the article should read as below to give a better WORLD VIEW and completely fair description...''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse, though the figure is very low the sensationalistic United States media which is generally centered to a WASP audience in particular enjoy blowing it out of proportion to present a negative view of Catholicism. < - > The first part of the first sentence (''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse'') sounds fine.

Of course Bevel is co-equal to Dr. < - > One Randy Kryn recently reverted a change I made almost three weeks ago to restore the name of James Bevel to the following sentence: ''A growing civil rights movement, symbolized and led by African Americans such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Bevel used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination.'' I believe it is obvious that Bevel has no business appearing alongside Parks and King in this context, and I have reverted Kryn's edit.
Controversies go in, as per WP:LEAD. < - > What is most recent is not necessarily what is most notable: new information should be carefully balanced against old, with due weight accorded to each.'' The position Ling.Nut advocates distorts historical perspective; compared with other controversies, the sex abuse scandals are barely notable, and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight.
That is a special meaning of ''valid'' which is not how it is generally understood in much of Western culture & it is not explained. < - > 'compatible with religiosity' only means Hinduism can get along with atheism. doesn't serve the purpose.

This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''. This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > But I think even if you did manage to do that, to make a full article page from the disambiguation page, the evidence that we have is that it still probably wouldn't be the page that the users want/need when they type in 'centrifugal force'.- (

The argument about authors being able to get ''their objections published in equally respected journals'' has been addressed a few times here and as stated in WP:PARITY ''Parity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia'' This is the case with research into astrology, not because of the quality of the research or the credentials of the researchers but the nature of the subject. < - > The policy you are quoting is in regards to subjects that are not discussed in mainstream journals, and we should not expect to find, e.g., distinctions in and arguments between different schools of ''Creation Science'' in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. This objection does not fit in this case. It is also somewhat ironic that the text of WP:PARITY makes it clear that it was intended to allow for non-peer reviewed criticisms of fringe theories (the cited example is criticisms of moon landing conspiracy theories) into articles covering those fringe theories, and you are applying it in reverse here.
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > It's the largest oil spill in U.S. history, that's not minor.
There is NOTHING at WP:CITE that contradicts Template:Cite book regarding accessdate=. There is just less mention of accessdate at WP:CITE. WP:PAGELINK, which you chose to ignore before, just omits discussion of accesssdate=. A contradiction would say ''do not use accessdate= if...''. < - > There is a contradiction, though: WP:CITE#Links and ID numbers says, ''For web-only sources with no publication date you should include a ''Retrieved'' date instead, in case the webpage changes in the future.'' (Emphasis added.) The ''Web pages'' subsection of ''Examples'', and only that subsection, lists among things typically to be included ''the date you retrieved it (required if the publication date is unknown)''.

Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. That means that these journals are simply not scientific, and should be considered as self-published sources. By pretending that these sources have equal weight with the publication in such a top ranked journal as Nature we simply discredit Wikipedia as whole.-- < - > These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''.
All it does is present events in sequence. < - > By including the information to justify Mary's actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth's, the article displays a pro-Catholic POV.

This article is not about waterboarding. < - > I see. So that's why it discusses the Spanish inquisition, the Algerian war, and the Khmer Rouge?

my biggest advice on reading restore me, or any other highly anticipated book that comes out multiple years after the previous one: go into it for the characters, not your own expectations. < - > you can always walk away from "they did something i disagree with," but you can't walk away from "i don't agree that this would happen." read slowly. read carefully. read to enjoy the characters, not with a checklist of what you wanted to happen.
I'm not debating the virtues and vices of capitalism here - I'm saying that the terminology and tone of this article is very clearly derived from the Communist Manifesto. < - > The terminology is prior to Marx. It comes from Turgot, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, etc. Its rather standard, and been used pretty conventionally across the board. The only word that comes from Marx himself is ''Capitalism''. And that's to his credit, since nobody else really identified it as a distinctive system before. It's not about being right or left.

If that were the case, this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general; for if a source is truly trustworthy/authoritative with regards to pseudoscience, then it speaks for scientific community in general. < - > Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves.
The lede currently states: > The term black people is used is a category sometimes used in systems of racial classification about humans perceived to be of a dark skinned phenotype, relative to other racial groups. As a black person, when I read this kind of sentence, I just roll my eyes. I find it extremely condescending and an affront to the intelligence of black people. < - > The reason it is necessary to have a vague word like ''perceived'' is of course because blackness is relative and a person whose skin is classified as white in the Dominican Republic or Brazil may be classified as Black in the US. What counts as ''Darkness'' and what doesn't is at least partly in the eye of the beholder.

Friends have told me nice AND mean things, so it's hard to tell when I think someone is bullshitting me, so almost by default I have to assume that everyone is full of shit (unless I've known them for a while). < - > I'd figure if a friend can tell you nice AND ''mean'' things, that means they're not bullshitting you.

(minus Ulster English; even then, the Irish nationals who speak Ulster English would be even more inclined never to use the term due to the political situation in the North.) From my experience, I know no one who would use the term to refer to Ireland and Britain. To associate the term British with Ireland is largely unheard of in Ireland. It baffles me that you use it. How about you give ME evidence to prove otherwise?

(There is a link within the section for the reader to read further about ''Criticism of religion;'' Wikipedia also contains a ''Criticism of atheism'' page, so the topic is not out of bounds for a complete online encyclopedia.) I would suggest that either adding a separate ''Dangers of atheism'' section, or combining them into ''Dangers of Religions vs. Atheism,'' would make the article more complete -- not to mention more neutral in its POV. < - > Better than mentioning both of them, in my opinion, would be mentioning neither, since the impact of religious belief (or lack thereof) on political activity is difficult to substantiate, and intrinsically controversial.
All the meanings, usages, and points of view are so closely interconnected and overlap so much that it's quite inefficient to try to discuss them all separately. < - > The page we have for that is the disambiguation page.

Virtually all criticism aimed at Obama is foot-stamping hyperbole by political opponents.

Don't read the comments.  Ugh.  #NationalSchoolWalkout #NationalWalkoutDay sure does seem to bring some interesting people out. < - > @IAmUltimatePred I don't agree with the walkout. There are other ways to address issues. The first would be to get to know kids from all areas in your school. It's not hard.  It is something I did. It's something I encourage my youngest to do (oldest is homeschooled because kids were hitting him)
.@RandPaul: "It almost seemed to be a little bit of glee in her voice that [Gina Haspel] actually enjoyed the torture, and I think that's not who we need to lead the @CIA... We should not reward somebody who actually participated in torture treatment." #OutnumberedOT https://t.co/Qe6Xt2fO9T < - > @FoxNews @RandPaul @CIA IN THE BIBLE, GOD ALLOWS US TO SUFFER FOR OUR SINS.  ONLY WITH JESUS' BLOOD ARE WE SPARED FROM ETERNAL PUNISHMENT, HOWEVER THERE IS STILL PUNISHMENT HERE ON EARTH.    I DISAGREE WITH RAND PAUL.  PRAYER WARRIOR
I hope she comes back, that would be brilliant. < - > I kind of hope she doesn't come back...
the misleadingly anachronistic consequence of the present emphasis, however well intended, and the fact that a clear consensus has yet to be established in favour of what you have already done. < - > Yes i forked the content when four people said it was OK and no-one had objected, i thought you had got over that?
Somehow I've always thought it's better to be blunt and confrontational, but then again...bleh. < - > I'll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with.
Basic income is not "giving" people anything.  It is RETURNING, in the form of money, what was taken, in the form of direct access to land, from people.  #BasicIncome #LVT https://t.co/aomxH34bnj < - > @JimbauxsJournal So it is here we disagree. If I work, and someone gives me money, then it is now mine and not 'ours'. There is no 'our work', 'our sacrifice' and 'our decisions', just like there is no 'our money'. Where we agree is on gov access to 'land' and how oil, farms, mining get benefits
Question 1 probably should be amended to state that Obama was factually wrong when he stated that he went to a Muslim school. < - > Now back to the topic at hand, I don't think Obama ''mispoke'' when he said he attended a Muslim school.
Dont lie This Tank was here long before 1992. < - > I never lied.
Emphasizing private ownership of capital is hardly glorifying; indeed, it is Marx's number one point. < - > Nice joke to define communism as the ownership of capital. Capital means private property and control of means of production. Communism means collective control over means of production, no private property at all, not any ownership, thus not any capital.
Reading the article I (as a Catholic) have two theories: < - > Or otherwise it may be 3) - a lifelong plan to troll the Catholic church which he's finally putting into action.
And it would seem, from the way you frame your arguments and your clearly biased language, that anti-abortion advocacy is the primary motivation for adding such illustrations to this article. < - > How is bringing what it is to light in any way biased?
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > Harris seems to have very little in the way of background to be granted the presumption of an informed opinion either way, he is a neuroscientist with a BA in Philosophy who seems to not know or appreciate that theism is a back-formation from atheism. Seriously. I think it is fine that he holds that view, but I think that the placement in that section is in error.
That's an odd comparison, and totally not true for me AT ALL. < - > no way, prof layton has puzzles and stuff
How exactly do you ''measure positions'' without a coordinate system? A set of axes IS a coordinate system. Hence the name ''coordinate axes''. Look, this has all been explained (as has everything else) previously. < - > No. Do you have a good reference saying that a frame of reference is exactly the same thing as a coordinate system? Because they're self evidently not the same. A frame of reference has an origin and a way of determining direction. A coordinate system is applied relative to that. A frame of reference can be a physical thing, or a mechanical construct. A coordinate system is not a mechanical construct. They are not the same.- (
Voice of the Faithful does not buy the argument that ''clamour created in the US around this scandal is really unbearable'' as Cardinal Bertone said. < - > I disagree with both of your perceptions.
Subjects such as MJ and Rihanna are limited exceptions to the vast majority of BLPs, but I maintain that a focus on those issues through personal life section detracts the encyclopedia from its main purpose to report on their primary notability. < - > I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia.
For these reasons, I feel that his response to the spill deserves mention.--The section on the oil spill is way too long. < - > This is a biography cover his entire life. Giving details of every incident during his presidency is impossible.
The comic relief scruffy Cajun lightning bug and the Voodoo Shadow Man villian characters were overly broad. < - > Though he was overly broad (and the stereotype bad guy), I kinda liked Shadow Man.

Also, the recent audit found almost all of the diocese in compliance - there was one or two that did not meet some requirement so they failed - they were in fact doing most of the things required but not all. < - > Eleven dioceses had not fully completed the training.'' Cheers!

I note that User:Neuromancer copied the section ''HIV discovery'' from the unreliable ''virusmyth'' website, while the ''HIV Types, Groups and Subtypes'' subsection was copied word-for-word from the site [5]. < - > First of all, the ''VirusMyth'' website was not copied.
No one is suggesting, or even thinking, that Ireland is part of UK. < - > The term ''British Isles'' does suggest that Ireland is British and therefore ''belongs'' to the British.
The ''controversy'' has the prominence it deserves. < - > That is very much in line with modern thought and not a ''controversy''.
Not for, like, the 13th pick. I get it if they are confused as to how the lottery works and think there's a legit chance they could get the No. 1 pick, go back in time and re-draft a 21-year-old Tim Duncan. https://t.co/kMgOt0TCQz < - > @JMcDonald_SAEN 4% of top 3 isn't likely (obviously) but it's something. Obviously those fans don't feel there's much point in limping into the playoffs only to get blasted in 4 games by the Rockets. If people disagree, that's fine, but wanting the lottery pick isn't crazy
Common descent actually does the opposite, keeping absolutly vital features of life the same in all this biodiversity. < - > Erm, I think we're thinking of the tree in opposite directions - moving forward in time, descent means divergence, which is the production of diversity.
Or do you now want to slander a priest the way you attempted to slander me in the personal attacks you attempted?-- < - > Reading my comments above, I do not think I have slandered you or this priest.
I'm very down on the sell-out to GM. < - > I didn't mind the update of the vehicles, but I wish they'd used more original voices.
It never ceases to amaze me that those who reject God, reject His Word, will borrow from the Christian world view based in the Bible for pronouncements about morality--they are so blind, so inconsistent, so hypocritical--&amp; they refuse to see this cause in their heart they know! < - > @aigkenham Very few people, Christian or otherwise would disagree with "though shalt not kill" the bit they take issue with is the many "save for when" clauses that follow. Just because the Bible got it right about murder doesn't mean it is right on homosexuality or other issues.
It might be trivial but I think that the sentence ''The manner of death was certified as ''undetermined''.'' needs citation. < - > Proganda. Both the commentary, and moral and legal conclusions.
Stay connected with loved ones on #Airtel4G. Dial *575# to enjoy the most affordable #chaopena data bundles https://t.co/eMfDCntBLi < - > @Airtel_Zambia Sorry I disagree, zamtel bundles are very low.
Thanks for the suggestion, but I agree with Grsz11 that it's too minor a detail to include for now. < - > There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article.
The history section still goes into a great deal of detail on persecutions of Catholics and barely mentions persecutions by Catholics. < - > Further to Karanacs objections: The article is necessarily broad-brush.
God bless. https://t.co/BQseRU5Fv8 < - > @DLoesch I don't always agree with you, but the abusive tweets you repost are appalling.  You, or almost anybody else, do not deserve this, and people need to better learn to channel their emotions toward the debate of ideas.
i mean who wants to read about my life, it's boring... < - > Well I always like to read about your life, so I hope you still find time to write about it :)  You're a very talented photographer, but I shall be hoping for some words here and there too :)
Responding to Karanacs: The present article wording does not mention justification of either Mary or Elizabeth's actions - it treats them equally - NPOV. < - > There are also little wording issues like The hostile criticisms of the Reformation which insert a subtle POV.
If the #Raiders finalize a deal with WR Jordy Nelson, they are likely to release WR Michael Crabtree, who has a $7.7M cap hit. That is in their plans. < - > @RapSheet I disagree with moving on from Crab (cut Roberts instead) but I would love the Jordy signing. Down year 2017, sure, when HUNDLEY was his QB. Before that, outside his injury in 2015 he's been an absolute stud. Great locker room presence, and will help Amari evolve. #RaiderNation
If we go for #5 then we'll move the three non-summary sections (''Theoretical concepts'', ''Characterizations'', ''Marketing'') to the TMT article. < - > These sections however equally apply to both the TMT and the TMM. Also four external editors supported option 1 while only three supported option 5.
Excuse us, but you referred to the purported ''Gini category'' as a ''fact''. < - > Surely you are aware that this is just tertile being expressed in more user-friendly way (colours and words 'high','medium','low').
1. Caroline Lucas is one of the leading architects of the narrative that there is a far right surge in the UK. It's a neat little box into which they can cram genuine working class concerns as a means to demonsie them and ignore them while parading their moral superiority. < - > @PeteNorth303 I disagree with your dishonest disingenous nonsense (healthy democratic disagreement) but you are spot on here, the demonisation of brexit, immigration curbs, overworked public services affect people lives daily &amp; refusal accept validity as intolerant as the right #stupidlytribal
LTC long term hold is coming up soon for a possible 150% gain potential, targeting $414. Assuming BTC finishes correction soon. A strong buy zone is between $158-$163. If it's never reached, it's up to you to buy into strength. https://t.co/3iTZ2U3GQW < - > @PhilakoneCrypto Um.. You serious?  We haven't even hit a stable accumulation floor...  Sorry but I don't agree with your TA. I think it's way too premature and high on 'hopium'.
#NationalWalkoutDay    There's strength in numbers. Make your voices heard. If I was in school still you bet I would have participated in this. My unwavering support is for the movement. Time for change fellas. < - > And for anyone that suggests that this has no impact, I completely disagree. The people protesting are literally the future of the country, and we'll shape how our adulthoods will be and how our kids futures will look. Take action and stop the vicious cycle we're in.
To be honest, I think the main reason we've been unable to consolidate the entire subject of centrifugal force (within mechanics), or even just the inertial/fictitious force part of the subject, into a single article is that some editors feel very strongly (just as did the guy back in 1898) that there is only ONE ''correct'' usage and interpretation of the term, and they don't want to sully their article with any hint or suggestion that there might be any other permissible usages within mechanics. < - > The different pages present different aspects of the term ''centrifugal force'', not different interpretations or points of view.
This is an important insight. I sometimes read papers that say things about practitioners (often managers) that it's hard to imagine the implicated persons identifying with. That doesn't make it wrong. But it should affect how you write. 1/3 https://t.co/O8nR3nzdEa < - > Of course, the same goes for the reaction of theorists, i.e., your peers. We sometimes write as though no one could possibly disagree with what we say. It's healthy to know the names of your most likely critics. Write as though they're real. As though they exist. 2/3
45 years ago today... https://t.co/jXhCFY9pK2 < - > @SenJohnMcCain It's a painful post to consider, but thanks for posting it anyway. And sincere apologies for those who take this opportunity to diss you. We don't agree politically, but when it comes to this, you deserve so much better.
Take down the statue of Lenin, then. < - > You are missing the point of my remark, Lenin is not the font of all evil as you appear to imply.
Two words - suicide bombers. < - > Concerning suicide bombings, they cannot be solely attributed Hamas.
A frame of reference has an origin and a way of determining direction. A coordinate system is applied relative to that. A frame of reference can be a physical thing, or a mechanical construct. A coordinate system is not a mechanical construct. They are not the same.- ( < - > As I said in the message to which you are responding, a frame is NOT a coordinate system, it is an equivalence class of mutually stationary coordinate systems. (Do you understand what this means?) But YOU gave your own definition, i.e., you said ''a frame is a set of axes which you use to measure positions'', to which I responded that a set of axes used to measure positions is a coordinate system, and hence your subsequent comments were non-sequiturs.
Their designation had nothing to do with elections status or democracy in the PA, and so should not change due to the elections.''you're going to justify dropping bombs on city centers and in the middle of civilian populations by saying they're ''military targets''???'' Don't twist my words. < - > law defining ''terrorism'' ( http://terrorism.about.com/od/whatisterroris1/ss/DefineTerrorism_5.htm), you will notice that groups considered to be ''states'' or ''countries'' are left out of the definition, implying that ''countries/states'' are not capable of ''terrorism''.

I tend to class it as heinous conspiracy regardless of how coordinated the effort was as a whole. < - > For it to be a conspiracy there has to be a guiding force, a cabal behind the whole thing.
But this article should be perhaps changed to 'Armenian Genocide Theory' or 'Armenian Genocide Claims' in order to neutralize the article. < - > A Neutral view is that the genocide occurred, and that it was carried out by the Ottomans, anything else is ludicrous.
You know, I am getting REALLY sick of this. I get that politics ain't beanbag, but FFS. It's one thing to have policy disagreements and organize sincere opposition, but this has gone too far, for too long. These people are domestic enemies &amp; it's time they were named &amp; shamed. https://t.co/5zwoEw95hF < - > @bloodless_coup Hard to disagree. When you run around calling yourselves "the resistance", you are 100% outside the "loyal opposition" you are supposed to be.
I'm not sure I have something to say about this https://t.co/QWD3vzRI1Y < - > @tianta_ I kind of agree disagree
Given that the version of the UK CoA used in Scotland is a CoA of the UK and not the CoA of Scotland, and that a single image exists which displays both that version used in Scotland and elsewhere, the image showing both versions should appear in the info-box as both are a Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. < - > Single version Dual version We should stay with the single CoA, as Wales & Northern Ireland are within the United Kingdom aswell.
Both sets of deleted text were inappropriate for this page and I see no benefit to keeping them: it only encourages folk to treat this page as a forum if they can see examples of discussions that are inappropriate (either on-show or in the archives). < - > I was not treating it as a forum, and you were wrong to delete my comments.
But a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience at some point. < - > First off, this is not properly a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by somebody at some point in time for all of history, but rather is properly presented as a list of topics that are characterized a pseudoscience in light of current, or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method.
The least disruptive course, I think, is to warn the IP (the registered editor has already rejected warnings) and close down the discussion threads that have no reasonable likelihood of leading to edits that improve the encyclopedia. < - > Oppose, if only because I am completely opposed to the idea of closing discussing and building a precedent for it.

Welcome to CA, @POTUS, where we celebrate diversity, innovation &amp; activism. We believe in climate change, DREAMers, and healthcare for all. We understand you...don't.  When you attack our state, we harden our resolve. We'll continue to build futures, while you try to build walls. https://t.co/VA9OsSAxaE < - > @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS That's Trump's MO. To attack his fellow Americans in states where the majority disagree with his agenda, even when  it screws his own supporters in those states. (1)

WE live in a world where knowledge is power. I am all for empowering our young adults, our future. I disagree with you on facts, not feelings Mr. Shapiro.  Thank you.
Wassupwestcoast is inordinately interested in putting more than just the facts into the sex scandal paragraph and it is clear from consensus of past discussions that his view is not shared by others on the page. < - > I have provided nothing but reputable sourced facts.
That works. < - > Frankly speaking, that proposal opens a Pandora box.
Let me clear up what I meant above, I certainly don't mean that we should exclude RS material just because it was written by atheists, not at all - what I meant to address was the notion that just because someone calls themselves atheist that they somehow have the ability to redefine what it means. < - > ''Redefine'' is question begging.
I do agree we neeed some photos but the use of photos of the tank and statue of Lenin are propaganda photos to try to associate PMR with communism. < - > That is not a photo of the Lenin statue, it's a photo of the Transnistrian parliament, which happens to have a statue of Lenin in front of it.
I was just thinking that the article is really more POV in the anti-Catholic direction because of the serious lack of commentary on the multitude of charities and good works accomplished around the world. < - > I've been at this NPOV problem on this page since 17 Feb 2007: see diff.
Obama has also taken full responsibility for it which attaches the whole incident to his ''presidential hip''. < - > It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly.

It has been agreed that the word Terrorist and Terrorism will not be used. < - > Just to remind that in archive 8 part 14 and 15 we discussed already the word ''terrorism'' and it was clear that the majority support it.
Look, you continue to delete and ignore the above words of Stommel (for example), and then you turn to the section of his book entitled ''Rotating Reference Frames'' where you extract some text that refers to (suprise) rotating reference frames, and then you claim that this represents the entirety of the subject according to Stommel and Moore! < - > I plead innocent of deleting or ignoring the discussion by Stommel.
Snare, after a few minutes of no oxygen a persons brain cells start to irreversibly go bye bye. < - > The brain does not function when there is no blood pressure, but nor do cells ''go bye bye'' in a few minutes either.

The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come &amp; go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! < - > @realDonaldTrump Any time you have to fire as many people as you have had to fire in the last year, there is CHAOS in the White House.   It is good to have people to disagree with you.  Sometimes it helps you make the right decision.

This implies the mindset that it's some external force influencing them, that they need to just pray against it or something. < - > Well, it's not as simple as ''pray against it''.
In my opinion, both the present and proposed texts are unsatisfactory, because they pay undue attention to this pre-WWII event. < - > I believe both the Spanish Civil War and the bombing of Guernica must be borne in mind to understand causes and roots of WW2.

Trump: NFL players who don't stand for anthem 'maybe shouldn't be in the country' https://t.co/2e9S65O6pD https://t.co/yf2Nk1qTfG < - > @KDVR I disagree. NFL players (and everyone else) who don't stand for our anthem DEFINITELY shouldn't be in our country.  No "maybe" about it. Other countries don't have a lot of tolerance for people who hate their own country, unless you're France.  Or Germany, or Sweden, or...
Rapid fire from Sen. @MarcoRubio explaining the danger of giving in to China on ZTE.  Every American regardless of political beliefs or party affiliation should watch this speech.

Full speech https://t.co/l1QThDqiei https://t.co/pYIYzrJgfz < - > @ReaganBattalion @marcorubio There are many things on which Rubio and I disagree (not this issue). Regardless, this video is an example of the kind of president we could have had, one who could have made the GOP, and maybe the country, proud, instead of a president hell-bent on destroying both.
Are your retweets an expression of your thoughts and agreements? < - > @iiv_lyn It's got to be! Maybe not necessarily an expression of thoughts but definitely an agreement. I would rather like the tweets that I don't agree with but interests me just so I can monitor the end-game than retweet same.

They have never been wrong. https://t.co/IGAzWPtOV4 < - > @officialmcafee Love the balls out detailed prediction. I can't say as I see any reason to disagree. Keep up the great work and don't forget to keep mixing in your typical McAfee shenanigans! Love ya, no homo.
Reached episode 41 in my HxH 99 rewatch last night. One of my all-time favs. It blows its 2011 counterpart out of the water. The only con is that this is also the first ep where the show's sound effects actually bother me. https://t.co/9JGgdKC1ZS < - > @AnimeAjay I respectfully disagree. I always felt that HxH2011 managed to sell the impact and tension in that fight way better, partly due to the sound design.
Trump says Democrats are 'sticking up for MS-13' @CNNPolitics https://t.co/Q9CUcvvVvp < - > @jaketapper @CNNPolitics My take is that the Democrats will find any way they can to make an argument counter to what Trump says no matter what. He could say the sky is blue and the Democrats would find a way to disagree.
There is more outrage over black athletes quietly kneeling during the National Anthem than there is over thousands of our kids being killed by guns.  We've banned protests which harm no one but done nothing about assault weapons.  Oh America, you are so lost. #ThursdayThoughts < - > @VABVOX @SCalaisS i disagree with you on this..America is outraged over gun violence in schools.. Remember we had the National march against guns on 3-24-18..it is in the news all the time..Nov we vote out candidates who are in the NRA pockets..
Bucks Organization Statement On Sterling Brown: https://t.co/W8prv5B4II < - > @Bucks Great statement by the Bucks...supportive of our athletes, our community, and our good police while rightfully calling out the bad ones.  Hard to disagree with.
Thread: While, for some of us who were at @marshill , the blogger @wthrockmorton elicited complicated feelings, it's simply wrong for @Patheos to delete the history of the work he published on the platform. Particularly the work that related to Mark Driscoll. < - > @wthrockmorton 's articles were helpful in sometimes bringing facts to the forefront and raising important questions that we weren't allowed to raise. We didn't always like everything he wrote, but we always had the opportunity to disagree...
I would not survive college in 2018 https://t.co/GKGL8ZOjUE < - > @samsanders Who are these psychos?  I went graduated college in the 504 (holla) in 2000 and this level of obsessive harassment towards those with which you disagree would have been completely unacceptable.  Academia the echo chamber, headed towards irrelevance.  Damn shame

I really hate Tomi Lahren but if you think throwing water at her is justified you're missing the point. < - > I personally think she deserves a lot worse but actually "throwing water" at someone who you disagree with only hurts your argument
It isn't common but it is possible. I have had discussions with people where we actually shared our different views + actually conceded on certain points. We all need to learn the art of listening + restraint sometimes. https://t.co/YN9VX3IDN6 < - > @Tracytms My well-hidden point was that it isn't a fully-realized healthy discourse if you wall yourself off from people who might disagree with you. I'm sure Ian isn't doing this, but I would suggest it is common given our universally tribalistic tendencies.
I think it was a misguided #Supernatural fan. She probably takes the show too literally and thought a splash of holy water would exorcise the demon.

Yes, Trump is just doing this to stir up a culture war that is very appealing to his base.   But since it has real world consequences (like the stifling of political speech), ignoring it is not the appropriate response. We just need to know that he wants this fight. https://t.co/0Txo8hRbvf < - > @TheAlanNoble This has been my main objection to Trump from the campaign until now, not necessarily his policies but his use of divisive, ugly language instead of uniting us, even if we disagree on certain things.  He brings out the worst in people, on all political sides.
It's true that trust in US media has collapsed. Also true they have done a lot to cause this &amp; engage in almost no self-critique &amp; thus can't fix it. But the absolute last thing anyone needs is a billionaire angry about negative reporting, spitefully using his wealth in vengeance https://t.co/0pisR1q0S7 < - > @ggreenwald I disagree. It's about time someone kept you guys (journalists/media) in check. Any efforts to promote this kind of review website by a grass roots movement would be crushed by another angry billionaire looking to protect his media interests. Elon has clout and resources
The Celtics, led by a rookie and missing their biggest stars, have all the makings of a classic sports underdog story. So why does the prospect of them in the Finals feel so deflating? @rodger_sherman: https://t.co/yk9hPsa4Lv < - > @ringer @rodger_sherman Disagree with the premise of this article. Celts have won one title in the past 31 seasons. They've had horrible luck (Bias, Lewis deaths, losing Tim Duncan draft lottery, the 2010 Finals loss). Winning a title this year would actually offset some of their misfortune (1)
Tomi Lahren wants you to know: 'I'm a real person and these things embarrass and humiliate me' https://t.co/BXeSg85ZmA < - > @RawStory Tomi Lahren apparently makes a decent living attacking and humiliating dems and progressives. Not to get to biblical here, but "you reap what you sow." Certainly don't agree that what happened to her is beyond any pale.
I was initially outraged by Trump's statement about people who don't stand for the anthem getting out of the country.  Then I remembered a lot of people just shrugged when the governor of the state I've lived in my whole life said I don't belong here.  https://t.co/oVTcAxquMT https://t.co/Fc4AQ0Jzbv < - > I'm willing to stand and fight on principle but if people who don't agree with me don't really think it's a principle that applies to both of us equally, it's not a principle. I'm not interesting in fighting to save you from attacks you're launching on me.

This is so fucking insane that Twitter thinks this is a debate https://t.co/rNpn5wsVJ7 < - > @ComfortablySmug Not sure how this is even a debate.

Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men &amp; Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE < - > @realDonaldTrump You have inflicted great pain against anyone who disagree with you!!!! You suck up to Putin and Kim but turn our allies against the United States!! You have used the bully pulpit to rain Dow on our own Intel agents, Justice Dept and house and Senate Democrats!?!!
Unsurprising to every conservative reading this  https://t.co/XJXWNY37Na < - > @dbongino The people that can't stand to even listen to an opinion they disagree with are this way because deep down in their psyche, they fear that they can't defend their beliefs and opinions, even to themselves, when faced with facts they don't want to be true.

It wasn't cause they were 'due'  #ALLCaps < - > @seanrcampbell Hard to disagree with that Mr. Campbell, but the challenge is that they've checked off all those same boxes in years where they had early playoff exits.

I'm going to miss my beloved @Ravens but we are in a dire time in this nation &amp; if Steve Bisciotti can't see the gross miscarriage of justice happening to unarmed black &amp; brown people in his city &amp; nationally &amp; support his players voice to protest same? I can't watch! #NFLVote < - > @SylviaKAlston @Ravens Understand your stance.  Don't agree. If the platform is destroyed then the message is muted.  I support the players protesting in a new way to support Professional Policing, Criminal Justice Reform, Education Systems Reform.

This is a good point. By the judge's logic banning anyone from twitter violates their right to read trump's tweets while having a twitter account. This is seriously a can of worms but potentially useful for conservatives being banned cc @PatriarchTree @ali https://t.co/O2voDkukNe < - > @AaronWorthing @instapundit @PatriarchTree @ali They can sign out of twitter go to his page &amp; read. Twitter doesn't give private pages. I disagree with the ruling because of it.

I do not understand how a multi-billion dollar company can utterly botch such a relatively simple "problem" as the whole anthem thing. Seriously. This wouldn't be a story any more if they'd just said "we don't like it, but it's their right" and stopped televising the anthem. < - > @RealMNchiefsfan Respect your opinion and your heart, as always, Seth. But I disagree. If you do not wish to stand for the anthem, players can stay in the locker room. But if you are going to be on the field, you WILL stand. Options for both. Don't see what the big deal is.
D24 #RombkLove - Disability recs - this is a tricky topic I think because as non-disabled readers, we may really like a book and the way the hero/heroine is portrayed then discover from someone with the same condition that they got it all wrong 1/ https://t.co/zsTiNdIO39 < - > D24 #RombkLove - so while I will list books I enjoyed, it's possible that someone else will disagree with the portrayal so take mine with a grain of salt please.

CNN Commentator Van Jones PRAISES President Trump After Meeting On Prison Reform https://t.co/aG6RlhyP8F < - > @Thomas1774Paine i have alway said i disagree with most of @VanJones68 political views: but was was always fair and called it as he saw it.
When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > (in an introduction or elswhere in the article) Again - I ask you to please provide evidence of the thriving Armenian colony where Ottoman Armenians were ''deported'' to by the CUP.
''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide? < - > This discussion about the use of the word ''deportations'' is over as far as I am concerned.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > You are suggesting making changes to the introduction of the article to correct semantic and not actually substantive errors.
The word ''deportations'' has been used since 1915 in relation to the Armenian genocide; one of the best known document's produced to illustrate the genocide's effects is the map titled ''The Routes of Deportations'' first published back in 1920. < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > On the contrary, I will always make suggestions for important changes to the article here in the talk page first, and will always engage with those wishing to make a positive contribution and will try to incorporate the reasonable views of others in any proposals I make.
I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians. < - > However, the talk page is not a forum to discuss the Armenian genocide or a forum to confront genocide denialists and their propaganda, it is actually a place to discuss the improvement of the Wikipedia entry on the Armenian Genocide.
So while I appreciate (and agree with) the points you are trying to make - lets not fall into the trap of accepting (essentially) denialist (and false) terminology.-- < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
It seems obvious to me - considering the scholarly analysis and the known historical record - that no Armenians were actually deported anywhere. < - > You, on the other hand, just seem to use this talk page as a platform on which to display your ego as you bash about the head visiting genocide denialists.
Some scholars (and Turkish apologists) point to some of the first ''deportations'' being from Eastern Anatolia to Konya (though most never made it that far and even those who did were qucikly re-uprooted and sent South into the desert...) - where the aim of the CUP apeared to be only lessening of the concentration of Armenians in what had been (in years prior) predominantly Armenian Areas (which were still very culturally Armenian). < - > So if we are attempting to change the introduction to improve accuracy - particularly in regards to semantics - then I would suggest we do it right.
I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)? < - > I agree that the term used be ''forced (death) marches'', for infact that is exactly what was used by the Ottoman Empire.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > Anyway I am all in favor of your contributing to the article itself in the manner you have proposed and I will certainly comment on particulars that I am either in favor of or oppose though I have no desire to be dictatorial in any way.
An answer as succinct and powerful as the one given by Lewis in the video above should certainly be quoted in this article. < - > It's all off-topic for this talk page.
(I really hope that's your goal... < - > You need to be much more wary.
I'd love a real response, i.e. < - > I almost forgot: you must recognize that a separate page for ''denial of the genocide'' is by no means sufficient.
You're really sticking your head in a hole with this one. < - > It's all off-topic for this talk page.
And, btw, I do know that in Britain recently a woman was actually convicted of a terrorist offense just for creating a work of fiction. < - > Let me help you a bit.
Of course that doesn't change the fact that Article 301 is a shame, but saying that it's illegal is a misinformation. < - > Still, I don't think it would be a different case if Armenians were in their shoes, they don't mind turning to brute force themselves.--
The manual of style dictates how articles are named, it being roughly ''The name by which something is most widely known in English, by which English-speakers are most likely to recognise it and refer to it''. < - > A very small minority dissent from this position, and if that dissent came from anywhere other than Turkey's government, we'd probably give it even less weight.
As the borg would say: ''resistance is futile'' < - > Germany did not come to terms with its genocide because they wanted to, they were forced to do so after being defeated.
It is a page to present views from both sides and a page to present a neutral view of events. < - > Just take a look at those that contribute most to this article, mainly Armenians, Greeks or brainwashed sympathizers.
you hide other point of views. < - > ''The name by which something is most widely known in English'' case would be true if the article had a neutral point of view, but the article is from the point of view of the claimists.
The majority of historians agree it was a genocide. < - > Until you (dance with the devil and nasmos)are taken out of your dream and into a reality, then this article will always be a biased and non-wikipedia class article.--
But this article should be perhaps changed to 'Armenian Genocide Theory' or 'Armenian Genocide Claims' in order to neutralize the article. < - > Even the Japanese think that getting nuked was probably the best solution.
Ideas? < - > Oh, and what ''claim'' did I make that requires a reference?
If you think you have that then WP:BEBOLD and just add your information, along with the reference that backs it up. < - > It is absolutely true that Asperger's sufferers are, in general, crippled in social and mental areas compared to the rest of the population, and that is highly relevant to the original discussion because it means that the idea that many more Asperger's sufferers are ''savants'' than the general population is completely false.
So yes you will need to find a source that meets WP:MEDRS for that. < - > If exposure to viewpoints that challenge your preconceived beliefs bothers you, I suggest you remove yourself from this discussion.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). < - > If not, then someone will probably revert it - and we'll discuss the matter here.
If you prefer, it would probably be better to discuss controversial edits here before you add to the article - but that's not required. < - > I've removed some insensitive comments, the result of which were to offend some editors here and to distract the talk page from discussing the content of the article.
I don't think you'll find reliable sources for any of the claims made (that Einstein or Asimov had AS, or traits such as ''delightful personalities, extraordinarily high IQs, extreme creativity, prolific excellent writing, and intense visual thinking''). < - > Please remember this is not a forum to discuss AS or people with AS in either positive or negative ways.
If you prefer, it would probably be better to discuss controversial edits here before you add to the article - but that's not required. < - > I have violated no rules.
Actually, per WP:NOTAFORUM, it is common to remove off-topic rants, but if Dbrodreck can solve the issue via another method, I'm not opposed. < - > It is agreed, citations are needed that conform to medical; I was merely proposing something and I get cybermugged.
If you want, if consensus is there, I can do that, after reinstating the other stuff, it is not that hard to do. < - > As I have explained above, the removals were unwarranted because they did not constitute a general discussion of Asperger's syndrome.
Although the IP provided none, his comments addressed other comments that weren't based on reliable sources, so it's hard to tell when NOTAFORUM should be invoked. < - > Any such comments may be removed or refactored.
It kinda puts me off helping you again. < - > I was not treating it as a forum, and you were wrong to delete my comments.
I move that these edits [2], [3], be reinstated and archived, per edit guidelines, for future reference. < - > It is agreed, citations are needed that conform to medical; I was merely proposing something and I get cybermugged.
See the bit at the top of this page. < - > You may invoke my name and beat me up all you like...
The course should have been for you to ask that I delete them or notify me of it before deleting them.-- < - > I was enunciating that Asperger's sufferers are, in general, crippled in social and mental areas compared to the general population in response to the assertion that the supposedly widespread phenomenon of ''savants'' exists within the ranks of Asperger's sufferers, which is of course false.
These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''. < - > On WP it doesn't matter how logical we, as editors, think an argument is, what matters is how logical or important the correct sources say it is.
If I am permitted to do that, I can prove statistically that goobles wurble whenever one cages a sage in the flowering season, and do so with a significance of better than 0.0001. < - > The first sentence (''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.'') is quite sufficient, otherwise we have a ridiculous and unacceptable situation when the mainstream views (Carlson) are being discussed in lesser details than the fringe sources that criticise them.
Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. < - > It is also somewhat ironic that the text of WP:PARITY makes it clear that it was intended to allow for non-peer reviewed criticisms of fringe theories (the cited example is criticisms of moon landing conspiracy theories) into articles covering those fringe theories, and you are applying it in reverse here.
That means that these journals are simply not scientific, and should be considered as self-published sources. < - > Peer review of meaningless rubbish however, is a far trickier thing.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > I have no problem with reading comprehension.
Please do not change my signature, play with your own. < - > You are right in the sense that ''Astrologers disagree'' with Carlson's conclusions - though that statement invites the comment - they would, wouldn't they?
It looks like I got here too late, the page has already been unlocked. < - > Just follow these simple steps...
Try as they might, astrologers are unable to systematize their claims and evidence, and every single astrological hypothesis that has been scrutinized has been duly rejected and falsified enough to make all claims of scientific validity a pathological science. < - > Yet, most new editors invited in from outside are expected to understand the detail and the nuances from a snapshot.
This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Any mention of the opinion of these journals to criticize Nature would be a serious NPOV violation, specifically DUE, as well as an RS problem. < - > Easy as pie.
At any rate, that is what my peers say. < - > Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis Perform an experiment and collect data, testing the hypothesis Analyze the data Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis Publish results (in actual peer-reviewed journals) Retest and refine (frequently done by other scientists) We call this science and it is the only method humans have for accurately predicing the future.
Alternatively, we can refer only to the opinion of Eysenck, who is notable enough to be explicitly mentioned. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > It can be seen that many RFC contributors have failed to realise that the reference to the Carlson criticism is not a vindication of astrology, merely an indication that this study, like the Gauquelin study, has been blighted by significant controversy.
I concur with others that there might be some problems with the phrasing of the RfC above. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Fringe journals publish what can't be published elsewhere because it wouldn't meet real scientific scrutiny. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
Oppose To using this phrasing or another, per the reasons I have given previously. < - > I will not support this RFC - this has nothing to do with ''honoring community consensus''.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > I think the old encyclopedias were better and I've heard others say it too.
Fifelfoo (talk) 02:15, 9 November 2011 (UTC) None of these three journals (Astrological Journal, Correlation, and Journal of Scientific Exploration) have been listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge database. < - > Making a blanket statement that you will not honor the community consensus, regardless of what it is, is probably not going to be helpful to you or your position, and throws up a major red flag in terms of your ability to engage in wikipedia productively.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > Good editors have contributed to this RFC discussion in good faith, but not having been exposed to the full arguments and the consequences of them.
If you follow the threads you will see that in this instance, two of the psychology professors Eysenck and Ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write ''Scientists disagree...'' or ''Psychologists disagree ...''. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
If it's not then it's not big deal, but if it is and it's not posted then it doesn't give the review admin all the information s/he may need. < - > Oppose The edit conflict seems to be between a small group, who are trying to give fringe sources parity with reliable ones, and a larger group determined to maintain the distinction between the two.
Thank you. < - > This is a very inappropriate remark.
Some editors at Astrology are intent on adding the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature into the article (see here for full context: [[5]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Modern astrology is bunk so say the experts who are in the know.
Oppose inclusion per WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE. < - > This is not to reflect poorly on you as an editor, but rather it allows the reviewing admin to take into account what might be relevant to your contribution.
There are a number of reliable secondary sources that could be used instead. < - > Based on the results of this RFC, I suggest we ask for unprotection since there is a clear consensus to remove.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > The correct question, therefore, is ''should we add it?''
And I could get peers to review it too. < - > Oppose.
IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
The policy you are quoting is in regards to subjects that are not discussed in mainstream journals, and we should not expect to find, e.g., distinctions in and arguments between different schools of ''Creation Science'' in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. < - > IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it.
The rest of your argument is not relevant for this reason. < - > This is a distinction that seems to be hard for some folks to grasp but it's one that really needs grasping as all these attempts to use fringe sources in this way are simply beating a dead horse and ignoring policy.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > Whilever well known controversies like this receive no acknowledgement or mention in sources such as WP, adherents will feel vindicated in their belief that there is more to astrology than the scientific establishment is prepared to accept.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
Unless a convincing argument is presented otherwise, keep the Carlson paper, and ditch the fringe criticisms. < - > That's a misrepresentation of what I have said.
What phenomenon is this article about, anyway: academic conceptions of atheism, or atheism as actually practiced? < - > If you wish to argue that EB does not reflect the consensus position then I would have to say that you are making an extraordinary claim that you need to make a case for.
Thomas Huxley, for instance, was unhappy with ''atheism'' because it was too dogmatic; it made a definitive metaphysical claim about the nonexistence of God, for which Huxley believed there was insufficient evidence. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
In Michael Martin. < - > None whatsoever.
There are lots of counterexamples, and the text of the current article cites some of them. < - > You have also failed to establish that the EB article represents a ''consensus'' view as opposed to the particular conceptualisation of one particular writer.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > There is indeed a usage that interprets atheism as an index of certainty or dogmatism, an interpretation that is challenged by the work of many atheists who do not claim certainty.
I should also note that ''rejects'' is increasingly, it seems, becoming a term of art where the usage in scholarly works on philosophy is not the same as the lay reading allows - certainly if the lay reading entertains the notion that it is not expressing a certainty about a proposition. < - > The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed.
The distiniction is small but important. < - > That said, I think that we should probably include mention of the tendency to desire a redefinition of atheism that seems to make it overlap that of agnosticism.
Rather, they would hold that an atheist is a person without a belief in God. < - > Further on Gordon Stein and An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism see Martins review here where he notes ( emphasis mine ) ''The section on the meaning of atheism is also of particular interest, primarily for showing that in the past many atheists have not meant by atheism what is meant by that term today.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > I agree that there is diversity of opinion demonstrated in RS, but we should absolutely give primacy to the consensus position, and such a position does indeed exist as is made clear by EB and the majority of dictionaries and encyclopaedias.
This led those who were unable to subscribe to orthodox theism to coin new terms of self-definition, which would allow them to remain uncontaminatcd by the stigma of atheism. < - > 1) Which source do you believe adequately counters the claim that the modern consensus is ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.''?
2) Maybe I'm confused about the ''matter at hand''. < - > Obviously, Unomi, it does matter how atheists have defined atheism.
This is of course later eviscerated by Drange - to which there seems to have been little answer, but loads of IDHT. < - > You can't maintain that atheism is consensually ''a positive denial'' when Eller, for one, says it isn't a positive denial.
Well into the nineteenth century, the negative connotations of the word - as a term of abuse - persisted and came increasingly to be associated with immorality and lawlessness, two of the great fears of the nineteenth-century mind. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
To be without a belief in God merely means that yhe term ''god'' has no importance, or possibly no meaning, to you. < - > There is no consensus, contemporary or otherwise, that atheism requires certainty.
But I suspect that other editors may object. < - > On reflection, I would strongly favour the removal of all but the first paragraph from the introduction; the content in those paragraphs belongs in the main body of the article.
We are defining an -ism, so why would the reader not see the definition and its analogues as a refusal to accept a belief as their own? < - > If you tell me that ''my dog eats garbage'' could actually be understood to mean ''some dogs drink brandy'' I'm going to tell you that's not possible.
What I don't understand Peter, is how you missed the one meaning that the clause has to 99% of readers, and is meant to have. < - > It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for.
Griswaldo and Modocc, have you considered that some people have an interest in how the definitions are used because of how they identify themselves rather than it being a mere pushing against others who identify themselves differently? < - > It seems to me that we are discussing two entirely different things here, and I have low enthusiasm for the two of them, taken together.
So how does one get from this explicit rejection of belief in their existence to ''but not necessarily their existence?'' One simply doesn't because it isn't semantically viable. < - > Cheers.
This will continue until the rhetorical fad that is currently ongoing dies down. < - > Indeed!
As for the possible ambiguities, there is nothing ambiguous about not accepting a religion because you don't accept everything they espouse hook, line and sinker. < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
Tryptofish, I'm not gonna argue or bicker about the introduction too much right now because I think the main game in Wikipedia's coverage is actually on the atheism sub-pages, where some sort of covert war is being fought to legitimise conspiracy theories about atheism, opposition to atheism, and the existence of shadowy 'movements'. < - > Please be advised that a sentence that begins ''This article explains a range of .
It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
The trouble with ''Atheism is the position that deities do not exist'' is that although the position that deities do not exist is atheism, so is the position that a belief that deities exist cannot be justified. < - > I would have low enthusiasm for a lead sentence that talks about the subject being ''difficult to define''.
Ergo, it seems to me that the opening is ambiguous and could benefit from a clearer exposition if one can be found. < - > No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists.
Oh I wish. < - > I'm receptive to a short-and-sweet first sentence, so long as the lead section, as a whole, goes on to cover the three definitions of long standing.
Does this treatment of ambiguity cover your concerns, IP editor? < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
(again, after edit conflicts):That suggestion is simply a restatement of the article's third sentence, or third definition and it is contrary to the Britannica's definition, the source that is cited. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
I'll reinstate the passage we are agreed on. < - > I'm not sure what the questions about sourcing were.
Unlike agnosticism, which leaves open the question of whether there is a God, atheism is a positive denial. < - > Nielsen is *arguing* for a particular conceptualisation of atheism, not merely reporting an existing consensus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/atheism?show=0&t=1323944845. < - > In the early to mid-19th century, many atheists were proto-noncognitivists in their stated positions.
They are not at odds, and EB states the exact same delineation between agnosticism and atheism, the problem is that you are misreading ''rejects'' - and failing to account for noncognitivism which is the basis for preferring rejects over ''false'' - but they ( as Nielsen makes clear in contrasting agnosticism and atheism ) reduce to the same thing by different routes. < - > I'm saying that you are interpreting ''positive denial'' to a) mean something it need not mean, and b) a a consensus posiiton which it is not actually claimed to be in the text.
It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems. < - > Well, I've read the sources.
It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems. < - > I would urge you to point to specific sources that support your position, at this point I have no way of knowing to what degree you are presenting the sources as intended, or the quality of the sources to begin with.
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > Since I'm probably in the minority on this page (people who believe in God) I don't want to initiate any changes myself.
Seems like a fringe position to me..... < - > It occurs to me that the Harris quote is not the only part of the text that deals with issues other than the origins of the word.
hardcore. < - > To my way of thinking, when you opine that the vast majority of your fellow humans are basically out of their mind, because they believe in God where you don't, you're deliberately taking up a fringe position.
I think it is fine that he holds that view, but I think that the placement in that section is in error. < - > I was addressing the first sentence to Carinae, but the second sentence (about having it removed) to Johnuniq's comment.
Atheism used to mean something completely different to what it means today, so it is clear its meaning evolves over time. < - > That makes his inclusion inappopropriate in a discussion of the etymology of the word.
Since I'm probably in the minority on this page (people who believe in God) I don't want to initiate any changes myself. < - > Thanks, good.
Setting aside what anyone thinks about Harris, I find the quote useful here (and rather innocuous), in that it simply documents one point of view within atheism, about what atheism does or does not mean. < - > In fact, there is considerable discussion of how the word has historically been used as an insult.
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > And at the risk of saying something that really ought to go without saying, Scjessey was absolutely correct to revert Unomi's deletion of the quote.
Harris seems to have very little in the way of background to be granted the presumption of an informed opinion either way, he is a neuroscientist with a BA in Philosophy who seems to not know or appreciate that theism is a back-formation from atheism. < - > While Harris may well be correct, the fact is that the word does exist, and has been used with various meanings (many poorly defined).
That is a special meaning of ''valid'' which is not how it is generally understood in much of Western culture & it is not explained. < - > Also, it is disputed that atheism IS a ''form of belief''.
The word ''valid'' is certainly in the source, but who can unpack what it means there? < - > This could be changed to Moreover, atheism also figures in certain religious and spiritual belief systems, such as Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Neopagan movements[13] such as Wicca.[14] Jainism and some forms of Buddhism and Hinduism do not advocate belief in gods.[15] The lede is an introduction -- the details can go in the body--
The idea that religion is dangerous is one often associated with atheism, as the section explains. < - > Better than mentioning both of them, in my opinion, would be mentioning neither, since the impact of religious belief (or lack thereof) on political activity is difficult to substantiate, and intrinsically controversial.
Philosophical discussions will often lack (or include bias-selected) empirical data -- I could cite examples within this very article -- but that doesn't make them ''unreliable'' or unworthy of inclusion. < - > Although I'm not in agreement, I can see why some might not think the actions of some atheists and atheistic regimes constitute a specific danger of that worldview.
It could use a rewrite though to focus more on atheism and less on atheists. < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
@JJL - I think your suggested titles are better than any suggested so far (including what I had in mind). < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
Then I was going to expand on the last sentence of the article and report on the view of Dinesh D'Souza (who is mentioned in the Criticism of atheism page) and others that an atheistic worldview was/is the underpinning of brutal, totalitarian regimes like Soviet Russia. < - > Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism.
It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. < - > There is an entire article devoted to his religious views for those who care to read up on him.
There is an entire article devoted to his religious views for those who care to read up on him. < - > Although I'm not in agreement, I can see why some might not think the actions of some atheists and atheistic regimes constitute a specific danger of that worldview.
You are correct that he utilized aspects of Christian philosophy in his public speeches an policies, but I suspect that he was being pragmatic rather than dogmatic. < - > I will also acknowledge that, although I've heard Muslims and others criticize atheism, I am not as familiar with specific sources of that criticism as I am Christian sources (and I don't know of any polytheists' criticism of atheism, although I wouldn't doubt it exists); if others here would like to direct me to such sources for the sake of presenting a wider criticism of atheism, I will look into them and try to incorporate them (although I'm trying to keep the section brief, and those broader arguments may be better made within the Criticism of Atheism article).
These agnostics go beyond the problems of evidence and consider the problem of whether there could exist such a God. < - > Confusion which ''but unlike the atheist he does not think that he is justified in saying that God does not exist or, stronger still, that God cannot exist.'' and ''Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not'' from Nielsen clears up.
To talk about mystery, they maintain, is just an evasive way of talking about what is not understood. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
Most of the paragraph in question is about distinctions based on meaningfulness and referent rather than questions about existence. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
The parenthetic/appositive (with unclearly distributed scope) 3-words ''unlike the atheist'' cannot be taken out of context to override the extensive treatment they give that is contrary to your interpretation --which does not distinguish ''God'' from God.-- < - > Nobody has agreed that the response you got from someone at EB resolves anything in your favour--
Grow a pair. < - > even alot of people who do understand it might think that it's overly technical.
I agree that that topic is not adequately handled in the wiki article. < - > Only three words [''unlike the atheist''] are about any atheist position on existence (existence appeared in his comprehensive definition of atheism only with respect to an anthropomorphic God.
The clearest, universally distributed statement about atheists he makes in the paragraph in question is: Atheists... < - > Eldamorie, many dictionaries and encyclopedias contrast agnosticism as a matter of course, indeed that is the role of agnosticism in the EB article, they happen to have a complete article on agnosticism as well - but Nielsen seems to bring it in exactly because it is relevant to properly understanding atheism in context.
because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers... < - > Any wish to interpret the opening paragraph as something else than a summary is an extraordinary claim - EB is not alone in contrasting atheism with agnosticism along the very same lines.

I'm very concerned whether this article should be at ''Black people'' at all. < - > The last sentence of the intro reads: Other definitions of the term Black extend to any of the populations characterized by dark skin, a definition that also includes certain populations in Oceania, Southeast Asia.[1][2].
People coded as ''white'' benefit from its socio-political overtones whereas those coded as black are significantly disadvantaged by the label. < - > I find the title just ignorant and ambiguous.
As a black person, when I read this kind of sentence, I just roll my eyes. < - > And I would absolutely not dispute that claim.
It's very hard to describe such behaviour rationally and in an encyclopaedic way. < - > The reason it is necessary to have a vague word like ''perceived'' is of course because blackness is relative and a person whose skin is classified as white in the Dominican Republic or Brazil may be classified as Black in the US.
Protip: We do have darker skin. < - > I bet it contains ''ethno'' and ''geographical'').

Fictitious forces are fictitious. < - > etc., in other words, all the reputable sources that present the view of this subject that you are trying to suppress.
Of course, such transformations can be applied as readily to curvilinear coordinate frames as to Cartesian frames. < - > Here is the question you raised: So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other?
A coordinate system is applied relative to that. < - > What kills you is the actual (absolute) acceleration to which you are subjected, and this actual absolute acceleration is proportional to the applied actual forces.
In dynamics the coordinate systems are four-dimensional, including a time dimension. < - > And here is the rub: there are two usages of ''fictitious force''.
You said: A frame is just a class of coordinate systems, and explain what he means when he says you ''get'' a certain force in a certain frame but you do or do not ''get'' the same force in certain coordinate systems within that frame. < - > Fictitious forces do not contribute at all to your absolute acceleration.

Within that context, the entire subject of centrifugal force is very simple, unified, and coherent, but without making use of that formalism (which requires a level of abstraction that is unfamiliar to some), it splits into seemingly disjoint subjects, hence all the forking. < - > Therefore, instead of saying, for example, that the trajectory of a stone dropped out of a running train is a straight line for a train observer and a parabola for a ground observer, it is better to say that the trajectory is a straight line in the train's frame of reference and a parabola in the ground's frame of reference.

Partly also because everyone has an intuitive notion of centrifugal force that gives it a reality not easily supplanted by abstract arguments about ''frames of reference''. < - > Of course, more general, non-planar trajectories along 3-dimensional curves could also be treated by extending the formalism to include things like torsion.
By broadening the discussion to treat fictitious forces in general, rather than the very particular centrifugal force, a very general treatment for the case of particle motion in both inertial and non-inertial frames employing Cartesian coordinates is provided at fictitious force. < - > What you most likely mean is something like ''the results of measurements performed by observers in disparate states of motion''.
Within that context, the entire subject of centrifugal force is very simple, unified, and coherent, but without making use of that formalism (which requires a level of abstraction that is unfamiliar to some), it splits into seemingly disjoint subjects, hence all the forking. < - > are they rotating?

Nobody here says that the term isn't used that way. < - > There was nothing abusive in my response, unless you consider that anyone who disagrees with you, and backs up their disagreement with detailed explanations and extensive references, is ''abusive''.
A complete and detailed treatment is in centrifugal force (planar motion). < - > The problem with the current article is that it seems determined to give the reader the impression that this one specialized sub-set of the subject of centrifugal force in classical mechanics constitutes the entire proper content of the subject.
Fugal: You might have a point that a better intro could be drafted in terms of some ethereal approach to the subject that you understand. < - > That is simply an incorrect and misleading statement.
As has already been explained repeatedly and at length, the references you mentioned (along with many others) explicitly support what I'm saying, and contradict what you are saying. < - > It would just simply be undue weight to include it here: WP:UNDUE.

I'd say further that the standard and predominant viewpoint of classical mechanics is this one, As already explained, predominant does not imply exclusive. < - > Thus, the available literature treats the matter in a manner consistent with the articles.
So your argument is moot, either way. < - > Does anyone know if this is a regretful coincidence or manipulation?
Well, yeah. < - > I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''.
Hence your excursion into Labrangian mechanics is pointless. < - > Here is the quote from the article (where links can be found): Treat the fictitious forces like real forces, and pretend you are in an inertial frame.
In any case, I think it's fair to say that the ''predominance'' mentioned by Brews is not a fact in evidence. < - > In fact, the above comments just give another display of the very problem that Harald mentioned.
That sentence is false. < - > A second approach is to work directly in the rotating frame, where use of Newton's laws requires introduction of fictitious forces.
The above line-by-line critique is Fugal's opinion, no doubt, but is it supported by any fact or anybody? < - > So here is the dilemma: if the standard usage of centrifugal force is used, as in the present article, the result is an article consonant with the vast majority of the literature and with the common use of ''centrifugal force''.
His ideas are not supported by any reputable sources (not to mention that they are also false). < - > In such an abstract formulation, it is mathematically handy to treat every as a so-called ''acceleration'' and everything else as a ''fictitious force''.
In the Newtonian equation of motion, F = ma, these three components of the acceleration, multiplied by the mass, are sometimes brought over to the force side of the equation, and treated as fictitious forces. < - > You could just as well choose a coordinate system in terms of which that object is presently being subjected to a million tons of centrifugal force, in any direction you choose.
No wonder we're having so much trouble communicating. < - > (Needless to say, no one would mistake this for a claim that relative acceleration is absolute acceleration.) The quoted comment asserting that inertial forces do not represent interactions between bodies is somewhat sporty, and would raise eye-brows in more sophisticated circles, because we do not know whether inertia is ultimately attributable to interactions between bodies.
And you present no rational justification for suppressing what is obviously a variety of views on the subject of fictitious centrifugal force in rotating frames. < - > But this choice is strictly arbitrary.
Then at some later point in the article the subtlety of frames versus coordinate systems can be mentioned, at least to the extent of explaining how the terms selected to be treated as forces are chosen. < - > When this is done, the symbol ''a'' in the equation of motion represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating frame, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively.
I haven't mentioned the fact that many (perhaps even most) modern texts discourage the use of fictitious forces altogether, although I think it might be appropriate to mention this later in the article. < - > I say say bring back Tombe and let him write this as you guys are going nowhere with it as it now stands [unpunctuated and unsigned message, apparently left by IP server 71.251.184.32.] I'm not sure if the above comment was some kind of vandalism, or was meant to be taken seriously.
This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame). < - > You can use coordinate systems and coordinate transformations to translate from one reference frame to another, but they are not the same thing.
I'm not sure. < - > The centrifugal force is directed outward from the axis of rotation.
When this is done, the symbol ''a'' represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating coordinates, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively. < - > These forces are usually called inertial forces.
I agree that this article should not state or imply that the only meaning of ''centrifugal force'' is the ''fictitous force in rotating frames'' meaning, not that that is the only context (within classical mechanics) in which the term ''centrifugal force'' is used. < - > You plainly have not the slightest understanding of this subject, and aren't even equipped with the vocabulary or the conceptual background to discuss it rationally.
In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the coordinate system differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > How do you respond to this?
The proposed language is simply an example of words reduced to meaningless. < - > This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame).
I should have commented specifically on Wolf's statement, when he said ''This article about physics is independent of the coordinate system used...''. < - > In [the equation for acceleration] this acceleration is written as if it were due to some additional forces.
Here's another version of the proposed introduction that might be more paletable, based on the above discussion: In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a reference frame rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the reference frame differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > Coordinate systems are not reference frames.- (
The definition used is overwhelmingly the same as this article; very few use other definitions. < - > Now look at the following two assertions: Centrifugal force is an outward fictitious force in a rotating frame.
It's mostly the article you helped to write Harald.- ( < - > For example taking the rotating earth frame and including the rotation effect of the earth in apparent gravitation, this action-reaction pair is still measured on a merry-go-round.
My proposal for getting started on that task is presented in the previous section here on this discussion page. < - > This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''.
Careful here. < - > As it stands, this article is not just about rotating reference frames, despite it's parenthetical disambiguation.
This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > An outward fictitious force in a rotating frame is called Centrifugal force.
The old article talked about reactive centrifugal force, that's completely orthogonal to rotating reference frames; you can either, neither or both. < - > However, at the moment that page is more or less hidden while it should be the departure point after typing ''centrifugal force''.
Then this entire debate could be squelched and the tags on this article removed. < - > This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer.
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims. < - > In diplomacy one curries favor where and when one can.
Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church, but it isn't larger than Christianity and isn't a single body (there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi'a for a start), so I don't actually think that this is an especially significant fact. < - > The Holy See does not have very good relationship with the Muslim world based upon the pope's past comments and positions.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I viewed it as purely political in motivation.

While the link looks helpful, it starts out with the confusing description that ''the second law says that things get more disordered over time''. < - > For me the questions are, (1) are these widely held misconceptions and (2) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists?
The sun's energy would only increase disorder, and therefore, even with an energy source, evolution would still violate the second law. < - > I think that would be hard to prove.
On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths). < - > ...

Lets have a quick look at your criticisms: A lot seem to based on a perception, that many people in certain countries with anti-catholic backgrounds have been brought up with, that the Catholic Church was basically an evil, grisly organisation, and that there must be more to back this up. < - > Would that be a balanced picture - or POV?

I agree that if a source ''recanted the characterization'' we should talk about that. < - > But when we act like this - when we disallow based on our own views - then we have an NPOV problem on our hands.
Trying to paraphrase your argument, you say that reliable sources should be used, but that some editors only want to use reliable sources that are authoritative voices regarding pseudoscientific concepts. < - > Based on the discussion to rename this article, it doesn't seem like this would have much support.
Please stop edit warring to reintroduce this badly written and unsupported paragraph. < - > The problem was and is that this list does not serve as an explanation of the philosophical concept of a pseudoscience, but as a coatrack for fringe-bashing.

And the word coney referring to female genitalia is not archaic, it is still very much in common use but more commonly spelt as cunny, although admittedly it has lost any association with rabbits (hence no need for mention in the article!). < - > Always learning!
My intent was cleverness, which I clearly fell short of. < - > I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt (which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit, coney, cunny etc.

My intention, if I ever get the predation article up to scratch, is to include a small section on predation and move the hawk picture (or something similar) down to there. < - > Would an image of a US marine shot dead in Iraq be considered equally appropriate for the article?
I strongly suggest using an image from a war that didn't involve America (the graves from the American civil war is enough) and preferably one from long enough ago that it won't cause any edit disputes - the Mongol invasions for example. < - > We need much more input on this, as we currently only have one person for splitting (me) and one against.

Basically Neuromancer, pour through the archives of this talk page to see how this is flogging a dead horse. < - > The article should be combed over to remove conflation of HIV and AIDS; polarization of accept/deny should be avoided (as I proposed yesterday); the lead (already very good) could be improved so that it will lead countless concerned people further into the article.

So, when describing a controversy that has been given the label ''denialism'' (a contortion of the English language), why is it a ''misrepresentation'' or ''distortion'' of a *scientific* WP article to focus on *scientists* in that section? < - > I completely agree.

The fact that some people with HIV are slow to develop AIDS, and some people with immunodeficiency don't have HIV infection, does not disprove the fact that HIV causes AIDS. < - > As for VirusMyth, any ''wealth of scientific information'' should be found in reliable sources.

One more note - there are millions of people flocking to Wikipedia right now to get information, we should come to a general consensus on what has happened, and place a short line or two so people can get what they want. < - > Neither Rihanna, Brown, nor The LAPD have confirmed anything other than an ''alleged assault''.
And place a warning for information that is added that hasn't gone through the talk. < - > -
I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about ''the incident'' pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section.That said, I suppose since it's more about the charges against him, all that is mentioned there is more suitable for his article. < - > I think your personally feelings & fan relationship for Rihanna is getting in the way of how her article SHOULD be.
I agree that it's not big enough for its own section yet. < - > Controversial material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libellous.
There has been a push in BLPs to abstain from personal life sections and write biographies in chronological order in favor of WP:WEIGHT. < - > 1) I'm probably one of the most nuetral editors you'll ever meet.

A shock photo, whether of the pro-life or pro-choice variety, would be unencylopaedic and POV. < - > Yes, the procedure isn't pretty, however neither is a cesarian section, or a pap smear, yet these are equally safe and commonplace surgeries or procedures.
Aborting a fetus is ugly, no mater how you slice her. < - > I think the issue is one of scale: the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life, a grassroots organization, while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women's Lives.

An important milestone has presently been announced in that the Vatican now concedes that Islam has overtaken it in size according to 2006 figures. < - > What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims.
Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here, it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page. < - > Apples and oranges aside, this appears to be how the Vatican views the landscape, and as such, this event constitutes a tremendous psychological milestone from both the Muslim and the Roman Catholic point-of-view.

Nancy suggested just omitting them altogether, but I think other editors might disagree. < - > What is most recent is not necessarily what is most notable: new information should be carefully balanced against old, with due weight accorded to each.'' Given the 2,000 year history of the church, the sex abuse scandals hardly register when compared with the persecution by Roman emperors, Arian heresy, schism of 1054, Reformation, and French revolution.

I'm not so keen on: Suggested re-wording: Modern challenges faced by the church include the rise of secularism, and controversy over its prohibition of abortion, contraception and euthanasia. < - > I'm also concerned that the reason the Church opposed some forms of contraception isn't because condoms kill babies, but because of their view on sex and marriage.-
How about: ''Over the centuries, the church has engaged controversies of many kinds. < - > There are similar issues in Ireland and other parts of Europe, and somewhere earlier on this talk page someone brought up a book written about 2000 years of sex scandals in the RCC, so it's not necessarily a new thing either.
You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight, which exactly clarifies the point that I am making: ''An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. < - > Today, the church's public stances on contraception, abortion and euthanasia regularly make headlines, as has the scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of minors by representatives of the church.'' Have at it!
They have no place in the introduction. < - > It is very unfair to all of the faithful, hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them.
Highly-publicised cases of sexual abuse by clergy in the United States and Ireland led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse. < - > When we do mention pro-life, we just shouldn't separate contraception too far.
Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. < - > It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought.
It is certainly not for the introduction sefction to the church.I am sorry, you are NOT deciding what goes in the lead of the Catholic Church article. < - > And why are we still using the non-Catholic word ''pro-life'' ( consistent life ethic may work better).

Do the two different forms of mass need to be discussed in detail in this article? < - > I think everyone is trying to build a good article in good faith.
Please note that the article does not in any way assign blame to BP, something that is beyond the scope here. < - > I gave an example text above which eschews the blame game and other details best explored elsewhere, although I conceded at the time that it was only an initial draft.
When all is said and done the event might be worth a section this long, or maybe shorter, and we will have to make room for the rest of the story as it arises. < - > But if someone wants to remove aspects of this, I have a hard time imagining it will be as responsible a representation of what is left, and I'd like to see these points addressed, not just undertaken.
Just because it's a political meme, doesn't mean that the underlying issue and/or criticism cannot be included in the article. < - > Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP's failure to stop this early, as their plan suggested they could and would; yet at the same time, it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil, considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month. < - > You seem to be saying that we should have a link to what a drilling rig is.
If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this, that's what wikilinks are for. < - > And, while BP was 65% owner of the field, and so of the oil gushing from that field, the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals, and the investigations are looking into their actions, inactions and histories as much as BP's.
CNN has an article about Obama personally promising to triple the cleanup manpower [43]. < - > Thanks.
On May 28, 2010, Obama said ''I take responsibility. < - > We could fight any mention of the spill, or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world, and err on the side of making this section, you know, bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care (both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated).
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > And they are based on public perception, not legal conclusions or proven facts.
It still doesn't have much to do with Obama's biography, quite frankly. < - > Thanks.
-- < - > I'm afraid ''Obama's Katrina'' has all the hallmarks of a senseless political meme, like calling everything ''-gate''.
For example, Gerald Ford had a dog is not clear. < - > Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.
I should note that Bobby Jindal doesn't mention the spill either, which is equally ridiculous. < - > I hope it can be confined to large-scale water-borne disasters in the Gulf of Mexico, but I'm afraid from now on out, every time there is any lingering problem that a government leader cannot quickly fix they'll call it X's Katrina.
We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina. < - > I'm not an apologist for BP, who should pay every penny they owe and then some, and may well do so, but I am trying to use the record to correct the recounting of the way the newsiness has unfolded, or the abbreviated version of such, neither of which is remotely encyclopedic.
We have a similar section in Bush's article about Katrina. < - > Gerald Ford had a dog, Liberty is better.
There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article. < - > Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings, and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout.
I fully agree. < - > Obama's role, and the public's expectations of his administration, revolve mostly around BP so far, not Haliburton or Transocean.
If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this, that's what wikilinks are for. < - > Once again, this BLP must reflect only that which specifically relates to Obama.
I'll say it again, if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama's biography, I will not object at all. < - > As to your point about piping, I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic.
I should note that Bobby Jindal doesn't mention the spill either, which is equally ridiculous. < - > Until and unless one of the abovementioned things, or some other major detail, arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end, I really don't see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers.
I would suggest something more like this: Following a blowout at an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to review and report on the events surrounding incident. < - > Okay, I've made some minor cleanups and corrections.
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions, instead. < - > -
If so, it's unencyclopedic no matter how many times it gets repeated by the press. < - > What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean (allegedly faultily, with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks, indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton (allegedly shoddily; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year).
IMO that part is fine as it is. < - > The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs.
-I agree that the full Nicene Creed should stay. < - > Could she clarify those?; perhaps there is indeed more merit to those suggestions than I can currently see.
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page. < - > I think readers who are unfamiliar with the RCC or other Christian religions which use the Nicene Creed won't necessarily understand what it is saying.
Also, eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes. < - > Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence.
Re the moves, I understand that this really is an editorial decision, but one that does have other implications, as you allude to (although ones I did not understand; see below). < - > It still appears to me that driving the organization of the article so as to make these connections explicit risks giving the article assertive connotations, something that I think we all agree should be avoided, whether or not we agree it will actually happen as I suggest.
The section is probably too long, as I have already said. < - > If one were asked to write about a poem, one wouldn't just re-print the entire poem ...with the implication of 'read it for yourself, it is so obvious.' Almost all Christendom ascribes to the creed.
Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues. < - > While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown, there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV.
I could go either way; I just want it to be accurate and grammatical.I've made some small changes to the lead wording for improvement of flow. < - > The RC article managed for five years without having your favourite scandal in the lead.
I will put the figure in when I get it. < - > Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession, whether it be a doctor, dentist, store worker, gym instructor, etc...
if people are that interested in it, they will find a link in the article. < - > I know y'all will be unhappy, but these changes won't fly.
Karnacs, many people may ''know'' about scandals in the Catholic church, but rather than distorting historical perspective, something like Summorum Pontificum is a much bigger current event as far as the Catholic church is concerned. < - > I'm still trying to be very patient and nice, but good granny, if you don't read the policies/essays/etc., don't quote 'em.
I fixed the fragment, but if you want to word it better, go right ahead.-- < - > This then raises the question of NPOV, which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals.
This then raises the question of NPOV, which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals. < - > The child abuse scandals are also not strictly a US issue, although the article does not do a good job of pointing that out.
(Gosh did I really use the word ''fact'' over five times just now - that is why I need Xandar here - I cant speak English!)Good Granny again! < - > On the ''sex scandal'' front I think the article should read as below to give a better WORLD VIEW and completely fair description...''A sex abuse scandal involving around 0.02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse, though the figure is very low the sensationalistic United States media which is generally centered to a WASP audience in particular enjoy blowing it out of proportion to present a negative view of Catholicism.
There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article. < - > That being said, there's no real need to mention it in the introduction; your edit seems fine from my end.

I completely respect Ling.Nut, but I think he's wrong on this one and is not taking WP:LEAD seriously: ''It should establish context, summarize the most important points, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and briefly describe its notable controversies, if there are any.'' The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church. < - > Given the 2000 year history of the church, and all the things associated with the church, I'd say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight, based on prominence of placement.

However, I think we will be hit over the head a few times if we dont have any controversies noted in the lead. < - > Given the 2000 year history of the church, and all the things associated with the church, I'd say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight, based on prominence of placement.

Nice job Xandar! < - > The original sources, one of which was Kamen, actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence, (technically, released to the civil authority,) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out.
If anything, trying to force fit more criticism into Obama's article for the mere reason that he doesn't have as many as Bush's is bias. < - > God knows having non-biased political editors would never help with ''improving an article'', nor asking for this be ''constructive discussion''.
Well, that wasn't unconstructive! < - > They do not.
I have trouble following your arguments. < - > They do not.
In addition to trouble from people who want to ''balance'' the article towards whatever they feel is the correct pro or anti-Obama bias, we've had a lot of long term, persistent trouble from fake accounts. < - > There are going to be numerous successes and failures, or however you want to look at them, in any presidency that simply aren't significant to put in the person's bio.
You keep saying there's all these noteworthy problems that should be included in Obama's page yet you fail to name one. < - > Under the Iraq war, no mention of him voting ''against'' the surge [planned under Bush] that would later stablize Iraq?
Please see questions 6-9 in the FAQ list at the top of this page. < - > Some critics are calling this oil spill ''Obama's Katrina''.
It also incorrectly refers to the ''National Resources Defense Council'' (presumably meant to be the Natural Resources Defense Council of the same area). < - > We don't call it a criticism or a controversy, it is simply an event that happened.
There's not even a link to a criticism page. < - > If it's any consolation, the Presidency of Barack Obama article uses the word criticism four times, and the Presidency of George W.
I agree with OP. < - > And to what end?
We assert facts here, even fact about opinions, but we do not assert an opinion as fact, which is what an OpEd is. < - > There has been criticism of Obama by liberals.

It ignores the credibility of the arguments in favor of putting in a matching number. < - > God knows having non-biased political editors would never help with ''improving an article'', nor asking for this be ''constructive discussion''.
Obviously there's no way to fit everything into this article, but it is notable and noteworthy to at least MENTION that he's received criticism for certain things. < - > We assert facts here, even fact about opinions, but we do not assert an opinion as fact, which is what an OpEd is.
Please see questions 6-9 in the FAQ list at the top of this page. < - > Otherwise, ''Obama (or Bush) has nothing to do with the economy since it was there before they were even born''.
On the other hand, it's similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on, either before or after, as reliably sourced, and further, to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out. < - > In the lead sentence we establish that an explosion at an oil rig in the gulf caused the rig's destruction and an uncontrolled flow of oil into the gulf.
I would suggest something more like this: Following a blowout at an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to review and report on the events surrounding incident. < - > I gave an example text above which eschews the blame game and other details best explored elsewhere, although I conceded at the time that it was only an initial draft.
It is notable that there is an unprecedented gushing oil spill in the Gulf with tremendous ecological ramifications. < - > The other thing to watch out for in the recent edits is that a WP:PIPE should link to something the reader fairly expects from the text of the link.
--Some missing information added. < - > There are plenty of far more minor events from his presidency mentioned in the article.
In regards to the back and forth here, I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit, and Scjessey's response(while it does look POVish) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency. < - > I hope it can be confined to large-scale water-borne disasters in the Gulf of Mexico, but I'm afraid from now on out, every time there is any lingering problem that a government leader cannot quickly fix they'll call it X's Katrina.
But anyway, that's rather normal. < - > The editors here seem to have agreed to include a brief mention of the event, but not to give a blow-by-blow account of what happened, when, whose fault it was, and what all of the players - something that will likely never be relevant here because this is an article about the life and times of Barack Obama, not BP and its tribulations.
history, that's not minor. < - > Governor Jindal has a daily call with the White House [44].

At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy, we might drop a couple other issues to note that. < - > Instead it correctly notes that BP is the well operator, lead the cleanup / containment effort so far, and bore the brunt of the public cry for Obama to do something.
Actually, The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source, in almost all areas. < - > http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been ''exploded a Transocean drilling rig'' until Scjessey's complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to ''exploded a Transocean rig'', which you changed to ''exploded an oil rig'', which, as I've already established, created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page.
--Some missing information added. < - > Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings, and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout.

By breaking out those sections as you encourage, it gives the article a slightly more assertive tone merely by this organization, which could be plausibly seen to be subtle POV. < - > These two items: Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone.

When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > (in an introduction or elswhere in the article) Again - I ask you to please provide evidence of the thriving Armenian colony where Ottoman Armenians were ''deported'' to by the CUP.
''Ethnic cleansing'' wasn't that a phrase dreamed-up by some Washington wag-the-dog think-tank as a way of implying genocide without actually having to produce any evidence to prove genocide? < - > This discussion about the use of the word ''deportations'' is over as far as I am concerned.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > You are suggesting making changes to the introduction of the article to correct semantic and not actually substantive errors.
The word ''deportations'' has been used since 1915 in relation to the Armenian genocide; one of the best known document's produced to illustrate the genocide's effects is the map titled ''The Routes of Deportations'' first published back in 1920. < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
When writing my proposed version, I was aware of the limitations in the phrase ''It was characterised by the use of massacres and forced deportations'', but I was wanting conciseness. < - > On the contrary, I will always make suggestions for important changes to the article here in the talk page first, and will always engage with those wishing to make a positive contribution and will try to incorporate the reasonable views of others in any proposals I make.
I agree that ethnic cleansing (which includes the concept of both removal and extermination) has a wishy washyness about it (in the manner that some use it to sound less harsh then massacres/mass killings/genocide etc)and would hesitate to recommend its use for these reasons (and in fact the word ''genocide'' is certainly the more accurate word to describe the entirety of what occured - in plan, enactment and result) - though in fact term ethnic cleansing does provide a good description of the (at least initial) intent of the CUP who wished Armenians removed from Eastern Anatolia and (eventualy) from (nearly all) other areas (of the livable parts of the Ottoman Empire) inhabited by Armenians. < - > However, the talk page is not a forum to discuss the Armenian genocide or a forum to confront genocide denialists and their propaganda, it is actually a place to discuss the improvement of the Wikipedia entry on the Armenian Genocide.
So while I appreciate (and agree with) the points you are trying to make - lets not fall into the trap of accepting (essentially) denialist (and false) terminology.-- < - > If in fact these ''so-called'' deportations were in effect death marches and not deportations at all - shouldn't this point be clearly made and the fact that the word deportation has entered and remained in the lexicon as a result of deliberate misinformation perpetuated by the Ottoman Authorities attempting to cover up for their crimes and that it is now used primarily out of convenience - but in fact it truly does not at all describe either the intent nor the result of the actions taken.--
It seems obvious to me - considering the scholarly analysis and the known historical record - that no Armenians were actually deported anywhere. < - > You, on the other hand, just seem to use this talk page as a platform on which to display your ego as you bash about the head visiting genocide denialists.
Some scholars (and Turkish apologists) point to some of the first ''deportations'' being from Eastern Anatolia to Konya (though most never made it that far and even those who did were qucikly re-uprooted and sent South into the desert...) - where the aim of the CUP apeared to be only lessening of the concentration of Armenians in what had been (in years prior) predominantly Armenian Areas (which were still very culturally Armenian). < - > So if we are attempting to change the introduction to improve accuracy - particularly in regards to semantics - then I would suggest we do it right.
I've not used the phrase ''out of the Ottoman Empire'', nor have I used the word ''resettlement'', so I don't see what your objection to my proposed change is grounded on (or if indeed it is an objection)? < - > I agree that the term used be ''forced (death) marches'', for infact that is exactly what was used by the Ottoman Empire.
Regarding the issue/claim (understood - not by you) of resettlement or relocation - well I think that there is some legitimate scholarly debate concerning the degree to which the CUP inner circle - who directed the Armenian Genocide - had decided upon extermination - in advance of WWI (evidence points to intensive discussion and some claim decision as early as 1911) versus how much it was an evolving policy (like the Holocaust was - in regards to the aim actually being extermination of Jews versus ''ghettoizing, removing them from the majority societies and using them for forced labor). < - > Anyway I am all in favor of your contributing to the article itself in the manner you have proposed and I will certainly comment on particulars that I am either in favor of or oppose though I have no desire to be dictatorial in any way.

These arguments range from faulty design and conclusion by Professor Hans Eysenck (1986) and Professor Joseph Vidmar (2008) to the claim that the Carlson data provides statistically significant evidence favoring the astrologers by Professor Suitbert Ertel (2009)''. < - > On WP it doesn't matter how logical we, as editors, think an argument is, what matters is how logical or important the correct sources say it is.
If I am permitted to do that, I can prove statistically that goobles wurble whenever one cages a sage in the flowering season, and do so with a significance of better than 0.0001. < - > The first sentence (''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals.'') is quite sufficient, otherwise we have a ridiculous and unacceptable situation when the mainstream views (Carlson) are being discussed in lesser details than the fringe sources that criticise them.

That means that these journals are simply not scientific, and should be considered as self-published sources. < - > Peer review of meaningless rubbish however, is a far trickier thing.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > I have no problem with reading comprehension.
Please do not change my signature, play with your own. < - > You are right in the sense that ''Astrologers disagree'' with Carlson's conclusions - though that statement invites the comment - they would, wouldn't they?
It looks like I got here too late, the page has already been unlocked. < - > Just follow these simple steps...
Try as they might, astrologers are unable to systematize their claims and evidence, and every single astrological hypothesis that has been scrutinized has been duly rejected and falsified enough to make all claims of scientific validity a pathological science. < - > Yet, most new editors invited in from outside are expected to understand the detail and the nuances from a snapshot.
This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Any mention of the opinion of these journals to criticize Nature would be a serious NPOV violation, specifically DUE, as well as an RS problem. < - > Easy as pie.
At any rate, that is what my peers say. < - > Define a question Gather information and resources (observe) Form an explanatory hypothesis Perform an experiment and collect data, testing the hypothesis Analyze the data Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis Publish results (in actual peer-reviewed journals) Retest and refine (frequently done by other scientists) We call this science and it is the only method humans have for accurately predicing the future.
Alternatively, we can refer only to the opinion of Eysenck, who is notable enough to be explicitly mentioned. < - > Next time, the RfC should be more neutrally worded, something like ''Should the following text be added to [link to article#section]?''.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > It can be seen that many RFC contributors have failed to realise that the reference to the Carlson criticism is not a vindication of astrology, merely an indication that this study, like the Gauquelin study, has been blighted by significant controversy.
I concur with others that there might be some problems with the phrasing of the RfC above. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Fringe journals publish what can't be published elsewhere because it wouldn't meet real scientific scrutiny. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
Oppose To using this phrasing or another, per the reasons I have given previously. < - > I will not support this RFC - this has nothing to do with ''honoring community consensus''.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > I think the old encyclopedias were better and I've heard others say it too.

Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > Good editors have contributed to this RFC discussion in good faith, but not having been exposed to the full arguments and the consequences of them.
If you follow the threads you will see that in this instance, two of the psychology professors Eysenck and Ertel cited are not astrologers and have both been critical of astrological research so it would be possible to write ''Scientists disagree...'' or ''Psychologists disagree ...''. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
If it's not then it's not big deal, but if it is and it's not posted then it doesn't give the review admin all the information s/he may need. < - > Oppose The edit conflict seems to be between a small group, who are trying to give fringe sources parity with reliable ones, and a larger group determined to maintain the distinction between the two.
Thank you. < - > This is a very inappropriate remark.
Some editors at Astrology are intent on adding the following criticism of a peer-reveiwed study in Nature into the article (see here for full context: [[5]]): ''Criticisms of Carlson's study have been published in numerous astrological and other fringe journals. < - > Modern astrology is bunk so say the experts who are in the know.
Oppose inclusion per WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE. < - > This is not to reflect poorly on you as an editor, but rather it allows the reviewing admin to take into account what might be relevant to your contribution.
There are a number of reliable secondary sources that could be used instead. < - > Based on the results of this RFC, I suggest we ask for unprotection since there is a clear consensus to remove.
Editors should follow the thread to understand the background. < - > In this case ''astrological and other fringe journals'' seems to do that adequately.
Oppose current phrasing; the position is deeply fringe so it's not neutral to say ''One researcher says X; other people say not-X''. < - > The correct question, therefore, is ''should we add it?''
And I could get peers to review it too. < - > Oppose.
IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it. < - > This influenced initial comments and many subsequent comments may have been influenced following this misrepresentation - even though most of the misleading comments are now hidden under a 'hat' link.
The policy you are quoting is in regards to subjects that are not discussed in mainstream journals, and we should not expect to find, e.g., distinctions in and arguments between different schools of ''Creation Science'' in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. < - > IMO, if criticism is fringe, we cannot devote any space to it.
The rest of your argument is not relevant for this reason. < - > This is a distinction that seems to be hard for some folks to grasp but it's one that really needs grasping as all these attempts to use fringe sources in this way are simply beating a dead horse and ignoring policy.
It is only reasonable to demand that they demonstrate that the experimental design, execution, analysis, and above all, implications, be exposed to closer and more demanding examination than more routine work. < - > Whilever well known controversies like this receive no acknowledgement or mention in sources such as WP, adherents will feel vindicated in their belief that there is more to astrology than the scientific establishment is prepared to accept.
Nevertheless, they are being used to challenge a genuine peer-reviewed scientific study, using WP:PARITY and the fact they they are identified as fringe journals as a justification. < - > While the wording of the RfC could have been less biased (and now is), it wasn't done in such a way as to make the question fundamentally different.
Unless a convincing argument is presented otherwise, keep the Carlson paper, and ditch the fringe criticisms. < - > That's a misrepresentation of what I have said.
What phenomenon is this article about, anyway: academic conceptions of atheism, or atheism as actually practiced? < - > If you wish to argue that EB does not reflect the consensus position then I would have to say that you are making an extraordinary claim that you need to make a case for.
Thomas Huxley, for instance, was unhappy with ''atheism'' because it was too dogmatic; it made a definitive metaphysical claim about the nonexistence of God, for which Huxley believed there was insufficient evidence. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
In Michael Martin. < - > None whatsoever.
There are lots of counterexamples, and the text of the current article cites some of them. < - > You have also failed to establish that the EB article represents a ''consensus'' view as opposed to the particular conceptualisation of one particular writer.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > There is indeed a usage that interprets atheism as an index of certainty or dogmatism, an interpretation that is challenged by the work of many atheists who do not claim certainty.
I should also note that ''rejects'' is increasingly, it seems, becoming a term of art where the usage in scholarly works on philosophy is not the same as the lay reading allows - certainly if the lay reading entertains the notion that it is not expressing a certainty about a proposition. < - > The sociological article cited is about changes in belief/unbelief-certainty over time in individuals, it is not about how atheism as a concept in the philosophy of religion is to be constructed.
The distiniction is small but important. < - > That said, I think that we should probably include mention of the tendency to desire a redefinition of atheism that seems to make it overlap that of agnosticism.
Rather, they would hold that an atheist is a person without a belief in God. < - > Further on Gordon Stein and An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism see Martins review here where he notes ( emphasis mine ) ''The section on the meaning of atheism is also of particular interest, primarily for showing that in the past many atheists have not meant by atheism what is meant by that term today.
Thank you for your input, I have corrected the section above to clarify that the volume had Martin as editor - not as sole contributor. < - > I agree that there is diversity of opinion demonstrated in RS, but we should absolutely give primacy to the consensus position, and such a position does indeed exist as is made clear by EB and the majority of dictionaries and encyclopaedias.
This led those who were unable to subscribe to orthodox theism to coin new terms of self-definition, which would allow them to remain uncontaminatcd by the stigma of atheism. < - > 1) Which source do you believe adequately counters the claim that the modern consensus is ''that atheism is captured by a certainty regarding existence.''?
2) Maybe I'm confused about the ''matter at hand''. < - > Obviously, Unomi, it does matter how atheists have defined atheism.
This is of course later eviscerated by Drange - to which there seems to have been little answer, but loads of IDHT. < - > You can't maintain that atheism is consensually ''a positive denial'' when Eller, for one, says it isn't a positive denial.
Well into the nineteenth century, the negative connotations of the word - as a term of abuse - persisted and came increasingly to be associated with immorality and lawlessness, two of the great fears of the nineteenth-century mind. < - > EB does not claim to represent a consensus position.
To be without a belief in God merely means that yhe term ''god'' has no importance, or possibly no meaning, to you. < - > There is no consensus, contemporary or otherwise, that atheism requires certainty.
But I suspect that other editors may object. < - > On reflection, I would strongly favour the removal of all but the first paragraph from the introduction; the content in those paragraphs belongs in the main body of the article.
We are defining an -ism, so why would the reader not see the definition and its analogues as a refusal to accept a belief as their own? < - > If you tell me that ''my dog eats garbage'' could actually be understood to mean ''some dogs drink brandy'' I'm going to tell you that's not possible.
What I don't understand Peter, is how you missed the one meaning that the clause has to 99% of readers, and is meant to have. < - > It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for.
Griswaldo and Modocc, have you considered that some people have an interest in how the definitions are used because of how they identify themselves rather than it being a mere pushing against others who identify themselves differently? < - > It seems to me that we are discussing two entirely different things here, and I have low enthusiasm for the two of them, taken together.
So how does one get from this explicit rejection of belief in their existence to ''but not necessarily their existence?'' One simply doesn't because it isn't semantically viable. < - > Cheers.
This will continue until the rhetorical fad that is currently ongoing dies down. < - > Indeed!
As for the possible ambiguities, there is nothing ambiguous about not accepting a religion because you don't accept everything they espouse hook, line and sinker. < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
Tryptofish, I'm not gonna argue or bicker about the introduction too much right now because I think the main game in Wikipedia's coverage is actually on the atheism sub-pages, where some sort of covert war is being fought to legitimise conspiracy theories about atheism, opposition to atheism, and the existence of shadowy 'movements'. < - > Please be advised that a sentence that begins ''This article explains a range of .
It will remain an issue as long as there are atheists promoting the absence definition as a piece of convenient rhetoric, which is what it is used for. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
The trouble with ''Atheism is the position that deities do not exist'' is that although the position that deities do not exist is atheism, so is the position that a belief that deities exist cannot be justified. < - > I would have low enthusiasm for a lead sentence that talks about the subject being ''difficult to define''.
Ergo, it seems to me that the opening is ambiguous and could benefit from a clearer exposition if one can be found. < - > No, under some definitions of the word, even people who have never considered the existence of deities -- young children, for instance -- are considered atheists.
Oh I wish. < - > I'm receptive to a short-and-sweet first sentence, so long as the lead section, as a whole, goes on to cover the three definitions of long standing.
Does this treatment of ambiguity cover your concerns, IP editor? < - > Under the umbrella of non-theism, babies are non-theists.
(again, after edit conflicts):That suggestion is simply a restatement of the article's third sentence, or third definition and it is contrary to the Britannica's definition, the source that is cited. < - > I have struggled with the wording but your rendition cuts all the crap while containing the essence.
I'll reinstate the passage we are agreed on. < - > I'm not sure what the questions about sourcing were.
Unlike agnosticism, which leaves open the question of whether there is a God, atheism is a positive denial. < - > Nielsen is *arguing* for a particular conceptualisation of atheism, not merely reporting an existing consensus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/atheism?show=0&t=1323944845. < - > In the early to mid-19th century, many atheists were proto-noncognitivists in their stated positions.
They are not at odds, and EB states the exact same delineation between agnosticism and atheism, the problem is that you are misreading ''rejects'' - and failing to account for noncognitivism which is the basis for preferring rejects over ''false'' - but they ( as Nielsen makes clear in contrasting agnosticism and atheism ) reduce to the same thing by different routes. < - > I'm saying that you are interpreting ''positive denial'' to a) mean something it need not mean, and b) a a consensus posiiton which it is not actually claimed to be in the text.
It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems. < - > Well, I've read the sources.
It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems. < - > I would urge you to point to specific sources that support your position, at this point I have no way of knowing to what degree you are presenting the sources as intended, or the quality of the sources to begin with.
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > Since I'm probably in the minority on this page (people who believe in God) I don't want to initiate any changes myself.
Seems like a fringe position to me..... < - > It occurs to me that the Harris quote is not the only part of the text that deals with issues other than the origins of the word.
hardcore. < - > To my way of thinking, when you opine that the vast majority of your fellow humans are basically out of their mind, because they believe in God where you don't, you're deliberately taking up a fringe position.
I think it is fine that he holds that view, but I think that the placement in that section is in error. < - > I was addressing the first sentence to Carinae, but the second sentence (about having it removed) to Johnuniq's comment.
Atheism used to mean something completely different to what it means today, so it is clear its meaning evolves over time. < - > That makes his inclusion inappopropriate in a discussion of the etymology of the word.
Since I'm probably in the minority on this page (people who believe in God) I don't want to initiate any changes myself. < - > Thanks, good.
Setting aside what anyone thinks about Harris, I find the quote useful here (and rather innocuous), in that it simply documents one point of view within atheism, about what atheism does or does not mean. < - > In fact, there is considerable discussion of how the word has historically been used as an insult.
The Harris quote offers interesting commentary on that evolution, demonstrating how unusual the word is. < - > And at the risk of saying something that really ought to go without saying, Scjessey was absolutely correct to revert Unomi's deletion of the quote.
Harris seems to have very little in the way of background to be granted the presumption of an informed opinion either way, he is a neuroscientist with a BA in Philosophy who seems to not know or appreciate that theism is a back-formation from atheism. < - > While Harris may well be correct, the fact is that the word does exist, and has been used with various meanings (many poorly defined).
That is a special meaning of ''valid'' which is not how it is generally understood in much of Western culture & it is not explained. < - > Also, it is disputed that atheism IS a ''form of belief''.
The word ''valid'' is certainly in the source, but who can unpack what it means there? < - > This could be changed to Moreover, atheism also figures in certain religious and spiritual belief systems, such as Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Neopagan movements[13] such as Wicca.[14] Jainism and some forms of Buddhism and Hinduism do not advocate belief in gods.[15] The lede is an introduction -- the details can go in the body--
The idea that religion is dangerous is one often associated with atheism, as the section explains. < - > Better than mentioning both of them, in my opinion, would be mentioning neither, since the impact of religious belief (or lack thereof) on political activity is difficult to substantiate, and intrinsically controversial.
Philosophical discussions will often lack (or include bias-selected) empirical data -- I could cite examples within this very article -- but that doesn't make them ''unreliable'' or unworthy of inclusion. < - > Although I'm not in agreement, I can see why some might not think the actions of some atheists and atheistic regimes constitute a specific danger of that worldview.
It could use a rewrite though to focus more on atheism and less on atheists. < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
@JJL - I think your suggested titles are better than any suggested so far (including what I had in mind). < - > The atrocities of the French and Russian Revolutions have been linked to atheism repeatedly, by well-informed observers.
Then I was going to expand on the last sentence of the article and report on the view of Dinesh D'Souza (who is mentioned in the Criticism of atheism page) and others that an atheistic worldview was/is the underpinning of brutal, totalitarian regimes like Soviet Russia. < - > Using that standard, I could completely decimate sections of the Atheism article by removing all ideas put forth by Harris, Russell, Dawkins, and other apologists of atheism.
It's the subsection title that is the real problem, and I do agree that it should be renamed - e.g. < - > There is an entire article devoted to his religious views for those who care to read up on him.
There is an entire article devoted to his religious views for those who care to read up on him. < - > Although I'm not in agreement, I can see why some might not think the actions of some atheists and atheistic regimes constitute a specific danger of that worldview.
You are correct that he utilized aspects of Christian philosophy in his public speeches an policies, but I suspect that he was being pragmatic rather than dogmatic. < - > I will also acknowledge that, although I've heard Muslims and others criticize atheism, I am not as familiar with specific sources of that criticism as I am Christian sources (and I don't know of any polytheists' criticism of atheism, although I wouldn't doubt it exists); if others here would like to direct me to such sources for the sake of presenting a wider criticism of atheism, I will look into them and try to incorporate them (although I'm trying to keep the section brief, and those broader arguments may be better made within the Criticism of Atheism article).
These agnostics go beyond the problems of evidence and consider the problem of whether there could exist such a God. < - > Confusion which ''but unlike the atheist he does not think that he is justified in saying that God does not exist or, stronger still, that God cannot exist.'' and ''Atheism is also distinguished from agnosticism, which leaves open the question whether there is a god or not'' from Nielsen clears up.
To talk about mystery, they maintain, is just an evasive way of talking about what is not understood. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
Most of the paragraph in question is about distinctions based on meaningfulness and referent rather than questions about existence. < - > But really, Nielsen is one source.
The parenthetic/appositive (with unclearly distributed scope) 3-words ''unlike the atheist'' cannot be taken out of context to override the extensive treatment they give that is contrary to your interpretation --which does not distinguish ''God'' from God.-- < - > Nobody has agreed that the response you got from someone at EB resolves anything in your favour--
Grow a pair. < - > even alot of people who do understand it might think that it's overly technical.
I agree that that topic is not adequately handled in the wiki article. < - > Only three words [''unlike the atheist''] are about any atheist position on existence (existence appeared in his comprehensive definition of atheism only with respect to an anthropomorphic God.
The clearest, universally distributed statement about atheists he makes in the paragraph in question is: Atheists... < - > Eldamorie, many dictionaries and encyclopedias contrast agnosticism as a matter of course, indeed that is the role of agnosticism in the EB article, they happen to have a complete article on agnosticism as well - but Nielsen seems to bring it in exactly because it is relevant to properly understanding atheism in context.
because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers... < - > Any wish to interpret the opening paragraph as something else than a summary is an extraordinary claim - EB is not alone in contrasting atheism with agnosticism along the very same lines.
''The New Criminology,'' 1928. < - > Or it should come out in favor of a more recent study.

so we can read that ''the proportion of prison convicts without religious training place the percentage at about 1/10 of 1%.''. < - > The source is fine.

Are there articles on ''White people'' and ''Yellow People''? < - > I think the use of expression an expression like African, African-American or Afro-brazilians to be more appropriate in a formal setting.
I said that the article cannot possible attempt to explain the correct meaning of the term 'black people'. < - > This is the standard used in the Asian people article, which notes the common geographic origins of all Asians, and spends considerable time exploring the use of the term in places of citizenship and residence of people who're ethnically Asian.
I'm not a big fan of this naming convention either (mostly for stylistic reasons). < - > Personally I find it offensive to color code human beings - especially with codes that have negative / dimunitive connotations.
I said that the article cannot possible attempt to explain the correct meaning of the term 'black people'. < - > Perhaps ''People of African Descent''.
I know that Redskins diverts to ''Native Americans.'' Are we going to have articles on ''slanty-eyed people'' next? < - > Other cultures/language groups also label various peoples as ''black.'' But I may just be reading the above comment wrong.
I'm very concerned whether this article should be at ''Black people'' at all. < - > The last sentence of the intro reads: Other definitions of the term Black extend to any of the populations characterized by dark skin, a definition that also includes certain populations in Oceania, Southeast Asia.[1][2].
People coded as ''white'' benefit from its socio-political overtones whereas those coded as black are significantly disadvantaged by the label. < - > I find the title just ignorant and ambiguous.
As a black person, when I read this kind of sentence, I just roll my eyes. < - > And I would absolutely not dispute that claim.
It's very hard to describe such behaviour rationally and in an encyclopaedic way. < - > The reason it is necessary to have a vague word like ''perceived'' is of course because blackness is relative and a person whose skin is classified as white in the Dominican Republic or Brazil may be classified as Black in the US.
Protip: We do have darker skin. < - > I bet it contains ''ethno'' and ''geographical'').
The lede currently states: > The term black people is used is a category sometimes used in systems of racial classification about humans perceived to be of a dark skinned phenotype, relative to other racial groups. < - > And I would absolutely not dispute that claim.
From my vantage point in Mercia, I would suggest that we are all deeply inter-related anyway, since the genetic evidence tilts strongly in that direction, regardless of modern nationalist affiliations. < - > Let's keep that discussion in one place.
Just like North America is different to USA, and East Indies is separate from India. < - > If you have any new information to add, with reliable references to back them up, they'll be considered.
The word ''British'' in British Isles does not mean that Ireland is politically, culturally or otherwise British. < - > Where are your sources and references that back that claim up?
You expect people to read a full wikipedia article? < - > You seem so sure it's not a common name.
It must be changed. < - > Or at least not oppose it?
It's not the business of Wikipedia to prescribe ''correct'' usage; as a matter of fact the term ''British Isles'' is being used for Britain and Ireland. < - > This has been discussed over and over again.
It must remain at British Isles simply because that is the grouping's common name. < - > I doubt the average American uses it either as most Americans cannot tell the difference between England and Britain.
Very few articles are listed under official terms. < - > Worldwide, ''British Isles'' (or equivalents) is the prevailing term.
Ireland is not British, it never was British and never will be British so to call it British is, one, and insult to Ireland and it's people and two, politically incorrect. < - > Then what is the official term of the Solar System because I'm certain government's throughout the World use it.

Of course, such transformations can be applied as readily to curvilinear coordinate frames as to Cartesian frames. < - > Here is the question you raised: So what does it mean to ''get'' a [fictitious] force in a certain coordinate system (or a certain class of coordinate systems) but not in other?

Partly also because everyone has an intuitive notion of centrifugal force that gives it a reality not easily supplanted by abstract arguments about ''frames of reference''. < - > Of course, more general, non-planar trajectories along 3-dimensional curves could also be treated by extending the formalism to include things like torsion.
By broadening the discussion to treat fictitious forces in general, rather than the very particular centrifugal force, a very general treatment for the case of particle motion in both inertial and non-inertial frames employing Cartesian coordinates is provided at fictitious force. < - > What you most likely mean is something like ''the results of measurements performed by observers in disparate states of motion''.

Nobody here says that the term isn't used that way. < - > There was nothing abusive in my response, unless you consider that anyone who disagrees with you, and backs up their disagreement with detailed explanations and extensive references, is ''abusive''.
A complete and detailed treatment is in centrifugal force (planar motion). < - > The problem with the current article is that it seems determined to give the reader the impression that this one specialized sub-set of the subject of centrifugal force in classical mechanics constitutes the entire proper content of the subject.
Fugal: You might have a point that a better intro could be drafted in terms of some ethereal approach to the subject that you understand. < - > That is simply an incorrect and misleading statement.

I'd say further that the standard and predominant viewpoint of classical mechanics is this one, As already explained, predominant does not imply exclusive. < - > Thus, the available literature treats the matter in a manner consistent with the articles.
So your argument is moot, either way. < - > Does anyone know if this is a regretful coincidence or manipulation?
Well, yeah. < - > I call this the ''coordinate'' usage of the terminology ''fictitious force''.
Hence your excursion into Labrangian mechanics is pointless. < - > Here is the quote from the article (where links can be found): Treat the fictitious forces like real forces, and pretend you are in an inertial frame.
In any case, I think it's fair to say that the ''predominance'' mentioned by Brews is not a fact in evidence. < - > In fact, the above comments just give another display of the very problem that Harald mentioned.
That sentence is false. < - > A second approach is to work directly in the rotating frame, where use of Newton's laws requires introduction of fictitious forces.
The above line-by-line critique is Fugal's opinion, no doubt, but is it supported by any fact or anybody? < - > So here is the dilemma: if the standard usage of centrifugal force is used, as in the present article, the result is an article consonant with the vast majority of the literature and with the common use of ''centrifugal force''.
His ideas are not supported by any reputable sources (not to mention that they are also false). < - > In such an abstract formulation, it is mathematically handy to treat every as a so-called ''acceleration'' and everything else as a ''fictitious force''.
In the Newtonian equation of motion, F = ma, these three components of the acceleration, multiplied by the mass, are sometimes brought over to the force side of the equation, and treated as fictitious forces. < - > You could just as well choose a coordinate system in terms of which that object is presently being subjected to a million tons of centrifugal force, in any direction you choose.
No wonder we're having so much trouble communicating. < - > (Needless to say, no one would mistake this for a claim that relative acceleration is absolute acceleration.) The quoted comment asserting that inertial forces do not represent interactions between bodies is somewhat sporty, and would raise eye-brows in more sophisticated circles, because we do not know whether inertia is ultimately attributable to interactions between bodies.
And you present no rational justification for suppressing what is obviously a variety of views on the subject of fictitious centrifugal force in rotating frames. < - > But this choice is strictly arbitrary.
Then at some later point in the article the subtlety of frames versus coordinate systems can be mentioned, at least to the extent of explaining how the terms selected to be treated as forces are chosen. < - > When this is done, the symbol ''a'' in the equation of motion represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating frame, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively.
I haven't mentioned the fact that many (perhaps even most) modern texts discourage the use of fictitious forces altogether, although I think it might be appropriate to mention this later in the article. < - > I say say bring back Tombe and let him write this as you guys are going nowhere with it as it now stands [unpunctuated and unsigned message, apparently left by IP server 71.251.184.32.] I'm not sure if the above comment was some kind of vandalism, or was meant to be taken seriously.
This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame). < - > You can use coordinate systems and coordinate transformations to translate from one reference frame to another, but they are not the same thing.
I'm not sure. < - > The centrifugal force is directed outward from the axis of rotation.
When this is done, the symbol ''a'' represents just the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating coordinates, and the fictitious forces are called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler force, respectively. < - > These forces are usually called inertial forces.
I agree that this article should not state or imply that the only meaning of ''centrifugal force'' is the ''fictitous force in rotating frames'' meaning, not that that is the only context (within classical mechanics) in which the term ''centrifugal force'' is used. < - > You plainly have not the slightest understanding of this subject, and aren't even equipped with the vocabulary or the conceptual background to discuss it rationally.
In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the coordinate system differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > How do you respond to this?
The proposed language is simply an example of words reduced to meaningless. < - > This article is Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame).
I should have commented specifically on Wolf's statement, when he said ''This article about physics is independent of the coordinate system used...''. < - > In [the equation for acceleration] this acceleration is written as if it were due to some additional forces.
Here's another version of the proposed introduction that might be more paletable, based on the above discussion: In classical mechanics, when the motion of a particle is described in terms of a reference frame rotating about a fixed axis, the kinematic acceleration of the particle relative to the reference frame differs from the absolute acceleration of the particle by the appearance of three terms, called the centrifugal, Coriolis, and Euler accelerations. < - > Coordinate systems are not reference frames.- (
The definition used is overwhelmingly the same as this article; very few use other definitions. < - > Now look at the following two assertions: Centrifugal force is an outward fictitious force in a rotating frame.
It's mostly the article you helped to write Harald.- ( < - > For example taking the rotating earth frame and including the rotation effect of the earth in apparent gravitation, this action-reaction pair is still measured on a merry-go-round.
My proposal for getting started on that task is presented in the previous section here on this discussion page. < - > This is why, in the previous section, I suggested that a more appropriate title for this article would be something like ''Fictitious Forces in Rotating Frames''.
Careful here. < - > As it stands, this article is not just about rotating reference frames, despite it's parenthetical disambiguation.
This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer. < - > An outward fictitious force in a rotating frame is called Centrifugal force.
The old article talked about reactive centrifugal force, that's completely orthogonal to rotating reference frames; you can either, neither or both. < - > However, at the moment that page is more or less hidden while it should be the departure point after typing ''centrifugal force''.
Then this entire debate could be squelched and the tags on this article removed. < - > This still wouldn't match the content exactly, but it would be much closer.
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims. < - > In diplomacy one curries favor where and when one can.
Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church, but it isn't larger than Christianity and isn't a single body (there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi'a for a start), so I don't actually think that this is an especially significant fact. < - > The Holy See does not have very good relationship with the Muslim world based upon the pope's past comments and positions.
This should be inserted prominently in the first paragraph, however, I suspect this may engender controversy, so I make the proposal here pending communal approval. < - > I viewed it as purely political in motivation.

The sun's energy would only increase disorder, and therefore, even with an energy source, evolution would still violate the second law. < - > I think that would be hard to prove.
On average, the temperature of the earth is not increasing, and that's a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space (as radiation at longer wave-lengths). < - > ...

Aborting a fetus is ugly, no mater how you slice her. < - > I think the issue is one of scale: the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life, a grassroots organization, while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women's Lives.
